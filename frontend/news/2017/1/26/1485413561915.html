<p>Wednesday marks the eighth day since the authorities ordered the country's telecommunications providers to shut off internet connections to the regions of Northwest and Southwest.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera contacted Communications Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary, the country's minister of communications, who pledged to comment on the situation but he has yet to do so.</p>
<p>The internet blackout came after the government outlawed at least two Anglophone groups - Southern Cameroons National Council and the Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium - and arrested some of their leaders. </p>
<p>The groups had been pushing for so-called Ghost Town actions, in which they urge members of the public<span> to stay at home and shops and businesses to shut.  </span></p>
<p>The aim is to peacefully protest against what activists call the marginalisation of the English-speaking regions by government imposing the French language on their schools and courts.</p>
<p>The towns of Bamenda, Yuku, Nkambe and Buea came to a standstill on January 9, according to pictures and videos posted online.</p>
<p>Using hashtag Bring-Back-Our-Internet, many on social media expressed their outrage at the government's response to the protest. </p>

<p>Protests in the Anglophone regions have been going on for years, but intensified late last year when protests turned violent.</p>
<p>Anglophone teachers, lawyers and students have been on strike since early December with many urging peaceful protests to call for the establishment of a two-state federation.</p>
<p>On Monday, Cameroonian President Paul Biya reportedly signed a decree establishing the National Commission of Bilingualism and Multiculturalism in the country.</p>
<p>Activists, however, rejected the measure saying their strikes and protests are about more than language.</p>
<h2><strong>The discontent</strong></h2>
<p>Areas controlled by Britain and France joined to form Cameroon after the colonial powers withdrew in the 1960s.</p>
<p>As a result, the country now has 10 semi-autonomous administrative regions; eight are Francophone, while the Northwest and Southwest regions are home to approximately five million English-speakers.</p>
<p>Anglophones in the country have long complained that they face discrimination, saying that they are excluded from state jobs as a result of their limited French language skills.</p>
<p>They also complain that official documents are often only published in French, even though English is also an official language.</p>

<p>There are issues in the judicial sector as well.</p>
<p>The country's legal system is largely based on French civil law, but English-speaking regions still operate under the English common law.</p>
<p>Cameroonian lawyers say that the government is sending French-educated civil law judges who do not understand English common law to their courts.</p>
<p>Anglophone Cameroonians believe that only a complete overhaul of the administrative departments in the country and an inclusive federal constitution can end their woes.</p>
<p>Cameroon had adopted a federal government system in the 1960s but this system was later dropped after a referendum.</p>
