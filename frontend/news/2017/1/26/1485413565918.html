<p>During his electoral campaign, US President Donald Trump pledged to move the embassy to Jerusalem despite reluctance to do so by past administrations.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Voice of Palestine radio station on Tuesday, Azzam al-Ahmad, a member of Fatah's Central Committee, said the Palestinian Authority, or PA, planned to adopt a raft of retaliatory measures in the event of the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/abbas-warns-trump-move-embassy-jerusalem-170109160103757.html">embassy’s relocation</a>. </p>

<p></p>
<p>"One of these steps would be to withdraw recognition of the Israeli state," said Ahmad.</p>
<p>"[We would also] demand that Israel recognise Palestine as a state with Jerusalem as its capital."</p>
<p>The Fatah official went on to assert that Palestinians would "escalate their peaceful popular resistance" in response to any embassy move.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Osama Hamdan, the spokesman for Hamas,  a group that governs the Gaza Strip, told Al Jazeera that Trump should not add <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/hamas-warns-trump-moving-embassy-jerusalem-170125094624942.html">"oil to the fire"</a> by moving the embassy to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Jerusalem remains at the core of long-standing disputes between Israel and the Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel for 50 years - as the capital of a future state. </p>

<hr>
<p>Although Israel has claimed the city as its "eternal capital" since occupying East Jerusalem in 1967, the international community has never recognised the assertion.</p>
<p>Until now, most foreign diplomatic missions remain based in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>On Monday, the White House announced that "no decisions" had been made on the planned move, saying talks on the issue were still in the "very early stages".</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Republican politicians in the US introduced legislation, which is still winding its way through the Senate, to relocate the embassy and recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
