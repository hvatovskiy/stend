<p>The blue-chip stocks index quickly blew through the much-anticipated milestone in the opening seconds of trading on Wednesday and continued to gain as the morning progressed.</p>
<p>The new record culminates a US rally that started in the wake of US President Donald Trump's election, in anticipation he will produce pro-growth policies, but which had stalled in the weeks leading up to the inauguration.</p>
<p>The president's signing of numerous executive orders since his inauguration last Friday has reignited a rally that began after his election victory in November.</p>
<p>Trump marked the milestone with a tweet: "Great!#Dow20K."</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Great! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dow20K?src=hash">#Dow20K</a> <a href="https://t.co/wXFhXBLgag">https://t.co/wXFhXBLgag</a></p>
— President Trump (@POTUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/824268525862879232">January 25, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>Investors said crossing the Dow 20,000 mark was just a number, but still nice to have.</p>
<p>"There are no magic numbers but we like to pretend that there are," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The occasion was "like watching your odometer cross over 100,000 or peeking up at the clock and noticing that it's exactly noon", he said.</p>
<p>Thomas Roth, head of US Treasury Trading at MUFG Securities in New York, said the milestone reflects a belief that the pledge to cut taxes and regulation while stimulating the economy will be more business friendly and grow profits.</p>
<p>"While the Dow hitting 20,000 is one of the least meaningful data points on my screen, it does suggest that the equity rally is pretty broad-based," said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co in New York.</p>
<p>The Dow came within a point of 20,000 on January 6 as investors banked on pro-growth policies and tax cuts from the new Trump administration.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
