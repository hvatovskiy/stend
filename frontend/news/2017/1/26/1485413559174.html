<p>The reasons vary from physical issues to anxiety. </p><p>We spoke to four women who have experienced painful sex.</p><p>Natasha Kilby, aged 34, had experienced pain during sex throughout her long-term relationship with her partner but after receiving treatment they got married in December 2016.</p><p>"The problem started at university. Every time I thought about having sex, I felt horrible and I didn't want him to touch me.</p><p>"Eventually I was diagnosed with a very rare form of thrush, but by that point, the pain had created psychological barriers.</p><p>"The only way I could have sex was by getting really drunk or I'd force myself to do it, which upset my partner.</p><p>"I felt like I wasn't in a real relationship. For some time we only had sex once a year.</p><p>"I didn't want to get married until we solved the problem because I didn't feel like I could be a proper wife - our 'sex' life consisted of a peck on the cheek.</p><p>"I began to receive counselling, which worked and now our relationship is improving. </p><p>"The thought of having a baby used to be impossible but now we are in a much better place."</p><p>Hannah Bradley, aged 19, has always experienced pain during sex.</p><p>"Sex has been painful since I first had sex three years ago.</p><p>"I went to the doctor who suggested that I change contraceptive, then I was treated with dilation for vaginismus and later I had a procedure to cauterise my cervix, but these did not solve the problem.</p><p>"I had psychosexual therapy for two months, but I believe that the problem is physical not emotional.</p><p>"Now they think I might have vaginal scarring and tightening after untreated <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/lichen-sclerosus/Pages/Introduction.aspx" class="story-body__link-external">lichen sclerosus</a>.</p><p>"I found it very difficult that I could not have sex. I felt really left out of conversations with my friends, and like I could not understand their lives.</p><p>"I only felt pain and I was jealous of their experience.</p><p>"It makes me feel different. Most people my age have an active sex life and I cannot have that.</p><p>"It still upsets me. My partner is understanding but it is upsetting for him too. I want to have sex but I physically cannot.</p><p>"I hope that it will improve soon, but no-one knows what is wrong. I'm still young and sex should be part of my life"</p><p>Sarah (not her real name), aged 20, cannot have sex without extreme pain, which led to the breakdown of her relationship with her boyfriend.</p><p>"Sex became gradually more painful to the point where it was just impossible - my vagina would literally close up and not allow anything in without excruciating pain.</p><p>"The physical and psychological symptoms for vaginismus matched up with mine so I decided to go to my university's student health clinic. </p><p>"The nurse suggested that I do some stretches with my fingers every day and see how I felt after a couple of months - it was completely unhelpful and, if anything, I had even less confidence than when I walked in there.</p><p>"My GP later told me it can be a very psychological condition - my brain associates sex with pain and so my body does everything it can to prevent that pain. </p><p>"This condition has made me feel increasingly angry, frightened, isolated, inadequate, anxious and depressed. </p><p>"I fear not only sex but any kind of intimacy and I have lost interest in doing anything. </p><p>"This put a huge strain on my relationship, leading to daily arguments and constant self-blaming on my part. I kept thinking it was all my fault my relationship was ruined because my body was malfunctioning. </p><p>"Eventually we faced the fact that I couldn't continue with it any longer, with the guilt of depriving any form of physicality to the relationship as well as being constantly angry.</p><p>"I don't know what it will take to 'fix' me but I am coming to terms with the fact this is going to be my life for quite a while and I don't think I'll be able to have any form of relationship in that time. </p><p>"The psychological effects are more damaging than the physical - I strongly feel the shame of the inability to have sex. </p><p>"Health issues related to <a href="http://patient.info/doctor/dyspareunia" class="story-body__link-external">dyspareunia</a> need to be looked into - we all what know erectile dysfunction is but we hardly know anything about how dyspareunia affects women's health."</p><p>Margaret (not her real name), aged 68, has not had sex with her husband for 16 years because of pain she experiences during intercourse.</p><p>"There is a link between the physical side and the emotional impact.</p><p>"At the beginning we had sex a lot and I never thought something like this would happen.</p><p>"GPs are impatient and do not take me seriously - they say that women my age should not expect an enjoyable sex life.</p><p>"I got used to it but it has an impact on our relationship. </p><p>My husband says that he does not mind that we cannot have sex but it is important to me and it makes me feel really sad - I  feel like I've cheated my husband of a proper sex life.</p><p>"I used to think that it would improve but now I have just given up on the idea that we will ever have a sex life again."</p>
