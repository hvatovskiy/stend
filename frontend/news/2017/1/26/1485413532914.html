<p>Archaeologists, who were left stunned by the degree of preservation, have said the only reason they survived was because Priory Park was never built on.</p><p>Two houses and a third building were found. Moving images from a scan show the shapes of two buildings emerge.</p><p>It is thought the houses, which would have been worth millions today, were owned by people of importance.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-sussex-38747016" class="story-body__link">More news from Sussex here</a></p><p>Local geophysics specialist David Staveley, who had set out to identify all the city's Roman roads, was given permission to scan the parks because some might have survived there.</p><p>Following his scans, a small dig was carried out in Priory Park.</p><p>It is thought the houses were originally on a street but the road did not survive.</p><p>James Kenny, an archaeologist at Chichester District Council, said the scans showed a townhouse with rooms and a freestanding building in the corner.</p><p>"It's difficult to say what it might have been, but the walls did survive. It might have been part of a bathhouse, or a cellar, or a winter dining room with under-floor heating," he said.</p><p>Mr Kenny admitted there was "nothing exceptional" about a Roman house in a Roman town. </p><p>But he said: "What's exceptional is in a Roman town like Chichester, most of the archaeology has been interrupted by all sorts of house building."</p><p>Added to that, the city had no sewers until the 1880s and people had to dig holes in the ground, he said.</p><p>"An awful lot of archaeology was lost."</p><p>However, Priory Park, originally home to a monastery, had not been developed, and the buildings buried 0.5m below the surface showed a "remarkable degree of preservation", Mr Kenny said.</p><p>Further exploration will take place this year and there may also be a larger investigation in the future.</p>
