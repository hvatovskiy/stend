<p>The 30-year-old has been <a href="/sport/rugby-union/38742427">confirmed as England's captain for the Six Nations</a> by coach Eddie Jones - two days after his six-week suspension for hitting Leinster's Sean O'Brien ended.</p><p>Hartley will not have played for nine weeks before England's opening game against France on 4 February.</p><p>"I did think that maybe that was it," <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04qs5zx">Hartley told BBC Sport.</a></p><p>"But again, a conversation with Eddie - a very clear and direct conversation - and I know where I stand," he added.</p><p>Hartley, who led England to the Grand Slam last year, was banned in December after he caught the Irish flanker with a swinging arm during Northampton's 37-10 Champions Cup loss. It was the third red card of his career.</p><p>The subsequent suspension took the total number of weeks he has been unavailable during his career to 60.</p><p>"I obviously came back to Northampton and wanted to make a positive impact in a big game for the club," said Hartley. "It obviously went horribly wrong.</p><p>"Positive, dominant, hard tackle. That's what I was thinking. Obviously the outcome was different to what I intended.</p><p>"That walk off the field is never a quick moment. It seems to drag on for quite a while, but obviously gives you time to reflect and I understand I could have jeopardised a lot. </p><p>"I put myself and the team in a difficult position and since then I've had clear directives from the management of what they expect and here I am."</p><p>Hartley said that part of the directive from Jones was to improve his tackle technique.</p><p>"I've worked very hard with [England defence coach] Paul Gustard on that," added Hartley. "It's not something that just finishes now that I'm back playing. It's an ongoing thing."</p><p>Hartley was dropped from England's 2015 Rugby World Cup squad after he headbutted Saracens' Jamie George, but was recalled by the Australian  after he <a href="/sport/rugby-union/34875741">replaced Stuart Lancaster.</a></p>
