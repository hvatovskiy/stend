<p>In an open letter to the new US president published on one of its official web pages, the Taliban said the US had lost credibility after spending a trillion dollars on a fruitless entanglement.</p>
<p>"So, the responsibility to bring to an end this war also rests on your [Trump's] shoulders," it said.</p>
<p>Afghanistan was invaded by the US in 2001 and has become Washington's longest military intervention since Vietnam. </p>

<p>It has also been the costliest, with more than $100bn spent.</p>
<p>Taliban justifies its ongoing insurgency in the letter, claiming that the group's "Jihad and struggle was legitimate religiously, intellectually, nationally and conforming to all other lawful standards".</p>
<p>So far, Trump has had little to say publicly about Afghanistan, where around 8,400 US troops remain as part of the NATO-led coalition's training mission to support local forces as well as a separate US counterterrorism mission.</p>
<p>Two of Trump's top security appointments - retired Marine Corps General James Mattis as Secretary of Defense and former General Michael Flynn as National Security Adviser - both have extensive experience in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Taliban, however, warned Trump against relying on the kind of "unrealistic" reports presented to former presidents by their generals, saying: "They would emphasise continuation of war and occupation of Afghanistan because they can have better positions and privileges in war."</p>
<p><span>Calling the ongoing violence as illegal, ineffective, and aimless, the group claimed "the Afghans, as a nation ravaged by war for 38 long years, sincerely want to bring this war to an end".</span></p>

<p>"However, they know, despite whatever reasons for previous wars, the principle cause for the ongoing conflict is the presence of foreign occupying forces in our independent country," the letter added.</p>
<p>"You have to realize that the Afghan Muslim nation has risen up against foreign occupation."</p>
<p>The Taliban has made steady inroads against the Western-backed government in Kabul since coalition forces ended their main combat mission in 2014, with government forces now in control of only two thirds of the country.</p>
<p>It has repeatedly urged the US and its allies to leave Afghanistan, ruling out peace talks with the Kabul government while foreign forces remain on Afghan soil. </p>
