<p>Carter was found to have taken the prohibited substance methylhexaneamine, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Wednesday, meaning Jamaica's 4x100 metres relay team must give back their gold medals.</p>
<p>"The Jamaican team is disqualified from the men’s 4x100m relay event. The corresponding medals, medallist pins and diplomas are withdrawn and shall be returned," the IOC said.</p>

<p>"The IAAF is requested to modify the results of the above-mentioned event accordingly and to consider any further action within its own competence."</p>
<p>The IOC Disciplinary Commission ruled that Carter "is found to have committed an anti-doping rule violation pursuant to the IOC Anti-Doping Rules applicable to the Games of the XXIX Olympiad in Beijing in 2008."</p>
<p>Bolt is considered one of the greatest sprinters of all time, having won an unprecedented treble of consecutive golds in the 100m, 200m and 4x100 relay in three straight Olympics.</p>
<p>Bolt was unavailable to comment on Wednesday but in June, when sources familiar with the case told Reuters news agency that Carter had failed a doping test, Bolt was philosophical about the prospect of losing a gold medal.</p>
<p>"It's heartbreaking [the positive test] because over the years, you've worked hard to accumulate gold medals and work hard to be a champion ... but it's just one of those things," Bolt said.</p>
<p>"Things happen in life, so when it's confirmed or whatever, if I need to give back my gold medal I'd have to give it back, it's not a problem for me." </p>

<p>Trinidad and Tobago are set to be promoted to gold in the Beijing 4x100, in which Jamaica set a then world record, with Japan moving up to silver and fourth-placed Brazil earning bronze.</p>
<p>A reallocation of medals is subject to any further results from the IOC anti-doping retesting programme.</p>
<p>First-leg specialist Carter has been a vital member of Jamaica's dominant squad, helping the Caribbean island win gold medals at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics and the 2011, 2013 and 2015 world championships.</p>
<p>Carter returned a positive result in re-tests of samples from the Beijing Olympics for the prohibited stimulant methylhexaneamine, the IOC said.</p>
<p>Asafa Powell, who has himself served a six-month doping ban, and Michael Frater completed the Jamaica sprint team at the 2008 race.</p>
