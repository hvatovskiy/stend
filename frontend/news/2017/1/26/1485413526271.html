<p>Mr Trump told ABC News he would consult Defense Secretary James Mattis and CIA director Mike Pompeo about what could be done legally to combat radicalism.</p><p>The president said while radical groups beheaded people in the Middle East "we're not playing on an even field".</p><p>However, ex-CIA director Leon Panetta said it would be a "serious mistake to take a backward step" on torture.</p><p>Mr Trump said he wanted to "keep our country safe".</p><p>"When they're shooting, when they're chopping off the heads of our people and other people, when they're chopping off the heads of people because they happen to be a Christian in the Middle East, when Isis is doing things that nobody has ever heard of since Medieval times, would I feel strongly about waterboarding?" he said.</p><p>"I have spoken with people at the highest level of intelligence and I asked them the question 'Does it work? Does torture work?' and the answer was 'Yes, absolutely'.</p><p>He continued: "They chop them off and they put them on camera and send them all over the world. So we have that and we're not allowed to do anything?</p><p>"I will rely on Pompeo and Mattis and my group and if they don't want to do it that's fine. If they do want to do then I will work toward that end.</p><p>"I want to do everything within the bounds of what you're allowed to do legally but do I feel it works? Absolutely I feel it works."</p><p>Mr Trump indicated in a TV debate during the Republican presidential race that he might order troops to carry out waterboarding "and tougher" on terrorism suspects.</p><p>But he later softened his stance, saying he would not order the military to break international law.</p><p>Waterboarding is the practice of pouring water over someone's face to mimic drowning as an interrogation tactic.</p><p>It is widely considered as a form of torture and has been banned by the US.</p><p>Mr Panetta told the 100 Days programme on BBC World News: "The reality is we really don't need to use enhanced interrogation in order to get the information that is required.</p><p>"General Mattis believes that, others in the intelligence business believe that, and the FBI believes that, so I think it would be a mistake to go back to that.</p>
