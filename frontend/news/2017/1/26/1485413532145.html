<p>A consultation will be launched "in due course" on strengthening the existing law against such discrimination.</p><p>The move is in response to last August's recommendations from MPs on the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/womenandequalities" class="story-body__link-external">Women and Equalities Committee</a>. </p><p>However, the government will not give such women extra time to take their cases to an employment tribunal.</p><p>Business Minister Margot James said: "There should be zero tolerance of discrimination against pregnant women, or women who have just given birth.</p><p>"That's why today we are committing to making sure new and expectant mothers have sufficient protections from redundancy."</p><p>It is against the law to discriminate against a woman because she is pregnant or has recently given birth. </p><p>This legal protection should last from when a woman becomes pregnant until the end of her maternity leave. </p><p>But last year, the parliamentary committee heard evidence, which they described as "shocking", that discrimination was in fact common.</p><p>The number of expectant and new mothers forced to leave their jobs had almost doubled to 54,000 since 2005, they heard.</p><p>Research considered by the MPs also showed that 11% of mothers felt they had been forced out of their jobs, mostly by bad treatment by their employers rather than through direct dismissal or redundancy.</p><p>"This is clearly unacceptable," said the government.</p><p>The committee of MPs made 18 recommendations to stop unfair treatment by employers, with the key change of giving women greater legal protection now gaining government support.</p><p>Backing has also been given to the idea that employers should be required to carry out individual health assessments on expectant or new mothers.</p><p>Extending the rights of permanent employees to temporary, agency or zero-hours staff will be considered by a separate review of employment practices led by Matthew Taylor, of the Royal Society of Arts.</p><p>And the government has re-stated its commitment that leaving the European Union will not lead to a dilution of workers' rights in the UK.</p><p>But a call by the MPs, to extend from three months to six the time limit for discrimination cases to be taken to employment tribunals, has been turned down.</p><p>The government said there was no strong evidence that the current limit was a deterrent to making a claim on maternity or pregnancy grounds.</p><p>However, the government said it would consider reminding tribunals that they already have the power to be flexible and to extend the time limits, case by case, if they see fit.</p>
