<p>NDTV, a privately run TV channel, said there were around 30 children on board, aged between seven and 10 years old.</p>
<p>The NDTV report said that the school bus driver died instantly while the truck driver was admitted to hospital.</p>
<p>Javeed Ahmed, a senior police official, said the children were on their way to a school in Etah town, Uttar Pradesh state, some 270km southeast of New Delhi.</p>

<p>Police said it was not clear what had caused the vehicles to crash although collisions are a common occurrence on winter mornings, when northern India is frequently blanketed with thick fog.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted his condolences to the victims' families.</p>
<p>"Anguished by the tragic accident in UP's Etah district," he said. "I pray for those injured in the accident in Etah recover at the earliest."</p>
<p>Nearly 150,000 people were killed across India in road accidents last year, an average of 400 a day, according to data from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
