<p>Canadian crooner Michael Buble was due to present - but that's been in doubt since his three-year-old son Noah was diagnosed with cancer last year.</p><p>At the time, the distraught singer <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37876829" class="story-body__link">cancelled all future engagements,</a> saying he was determined to focus on caring for his eldest child. </p><p>It was hoped he'd be able to return for the Brit Awards, but <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/2637397/michael-buble-will-not-host-the-brit-awards-after-pulling-out-to-look-after-his-three-year-old-son-noah-who-has-liver-cancer/" class="story-body__link-external">media reports</a> are <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/michael-buble-steps-down-brit-awards-2017-son-cancer-noah-a7532871.html" class="story-body__link-external">suggesting</a> he's pulled out for good - and understandably so.</p><p>So, who could take the helm at the O2 Arena on 22 February? Here are a few suggestions...</p><p>Ant (stands on the left, a bit wacky), and Dec (stands on the right, giggles) were hardly at their best when they hosted the Brits last year. </p><p>The nadir was the moment when Ant "mistakenly" appeared on stage in a dress. Because a man in a dress is hilarious, right? </p><p>Coming so soon after a video tribute to androgyny-embracing pop lizard David Bowie, it felt particularly dated.</p><p>But with a better scriptwriter they're a safe pair of hands - and, crucially, able to draw a big audience.</p><p>Back in 2008 when Katy Perry was a relatively new and untested pop star, she took the helm of the MTV Europe Music Awards in Liverpool and totally stole the show. </p><p>Cheeky and energetic, she kept the event moving at a frenetic pace, racing through 10 costume changes and more than a few memorable moments. "Girls. Just a reminder," she said, while riding on top of a giant banana. "It's not how big the banana is - it's how you sit on it."</p><p>With new music to promote in 2017, could the star be coaxed into a repeat performance?</p><p>If only so they can go: "On your marks, get set, DRAKE!"</p><p>By hiring Michael Buble, the Brits were making a statement of intent: we want some showbiz, and we want a host a global audience will recognise. Adele is one of the only other stars that fits the bill.</p><p>In many ways, Adele <i>is </i>the Brits. From the stop-you-in-your-tracks performance of Someone Like You to the moment last year when she tearfully accepted an award from Tim Peake in outer space. </p><p>She's funny, she's charismatic, and there's 0% chance she'll do it. Which will be a relief for the person who works the bleep button.</p><p>He's already winning the Brits Icon Award, so they won't need to book an extra cab. </p><p>His propensity to go off-script might cause organisers a few headaches - but a double-header with his bff Olly Murs would be worth tuning in for.</p><p>Before he swanned off to become a US chat show host, Corden presented the Brits five times (including a stint with Kylie in 2009). He stood down three years ago, telling the Radio Times he didn't want to outstay his welcome.</p><p>"There are award shows where it actually becomes a plus that it's hosted by the same person," <a href="http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-02-19/brits-2014-james-corden-on-his-fifth-and-final-time-presenting-the-awards" class="story-body__link-external">he said</a>. "But the Brits should always have an energy about them that is fresh and new and exciting."</p><p>But imagine if the whole Brits ceremony was an extended episode of Carpool Karaoke? No pizzazz, no fireworks, no music industry "suits" - just a rotating cast of megastars in the passenger seat, with Corden fishing the occasional trophy out of his glove compartment. </p><p>TV Gold. But, seeing as he's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38066645" class="story-body__link">already presenting the Grammys</a> a week before, extremely unlikely.</p><p>The Brits have often looked to comedians to provide a bit of frisson - notably Russell Brand, who outraged (some) viewers in 2007 with his references to the Queen's "naughty bits" and Amy Winehouse's drinking problem ("her surname's beginning to sound like a description of her liver".)</p><p>Of the current crop of stand-ups, Jack Whitehall has both the profile and the requisite irreverence. His UK tour might get in the way of rehearsals but, by coincidence, he has a day off on 22 February. </p><p>In the year that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/articles/38628688" class="story-body__link">grime took over the Brits</a>, Julie Adenuga would be a brave but bold choice.</p><p>The Beats 1 DJ is one of the genre's biggest champions (as well as being sister to three-time nominee Skepta) but eminently knowledgeable about music from all walks of life. Apple Music is also sponsoring two of the awards - best British male and best British female - so there's also a commercial reason to use one of their presenters on the night.</p><p>However, she's untested as a live TV presenter, so unlikely to make the cut.</p><p>On second thoughts, no.</p><p>X Factor host and hot buttered crumpet Dermot O'Leary makes live television look like a walk in the park - when in reality it's a race through a field full of knives, on one leg, in the dark, tethered to an excited donkey.</p><p>Amazingly, he's never presented the Brits, but given his role as a new music champion on Radio 2, he's a perfect fit.</p><p>Big Brother host Emma Willis did a great job fronting the Brits nominations show on Saturday night, attracting a respectable 1.6 million viewers to ITV.</p><p>She told the BBC she was planning to watch the main ceremony from the audience - but if the call comes, she can recreate her favourite ever Brit moment, when "Cat Deeley flew in on a champagne bottle" in 2004.</p>
