<p>Korean Air is believed to be the only major carrier to routinely have the weapons on board.</p><p>The airline is ramping up training for staff using the guns after criticism for the way it handled a recent in-flight disturbance.</p><p>In that incident, US singer Richard Marx <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-38388451" class="story-body__link">was among passengers who helped restrain an unruly passenger.</a></p><p>Afterwards, both Mr Marx and his wife Daisy Fuentes used social media to claim that the crew was "ill-trained". </p><p>Ms Fuentes wrote on Instagram: "They didn't know how to use the Taser and didn't know how to secure the rope" around the passenger.</p><p>Taser is a brand name of a electric stun gun. The reference surprised many who did not expect airlines to carry the weapons, which are more commonly used by police.</p><p>The carrier told the BBC it first introduced electric stun guns in 2002.</p><p>It now carries at least one set of weapons on every plane, with two sets on its A380 jumbo jets.</p><p>A Korean Air spokesman said that of the five incidents, three involved the gun being fired.</p><p>In those instances, the gun used compressed air to fire darts that release a 50,000-volt electric charge, designed to temporarily paralyse the target.</p><p>In the two other cases, the weapon was used as a stun gun, with the electric current fired directly into the passenger, with the weapon held against them at close range.</p><p>Korean Air would not give further details about what prompted each incident, when they occurred or what happened to the passengers.</p><p>But it confirmed all took place while the aircraft were airborne.</p><p>After the incident involving Mr Marx, the airline said it was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38441521" class="story-body__link">training its crews</a> to use the weapons more "readily" against violent passengers.</p><p>It also invited media to see a session where crew were practising using Tasers.</p><p>Korean Air's former president, Chi Chang-hoon, said Asian airlines had not followed US carriers in tackling on-board violence and suggested "Asian culture" was to blame. </p><p>However, the airline's spokesman said that current protocol limited cabin crews to using tasters "only during life threatening situation or when the safety of an aircraft is threatened".</p><p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said airlines were not required to inform them if they carried the weapons on board.</p><p>Several major carriers contacted by the BBC declined to comment on whether or not they had Tasers on board, citing security concerns.</p><p>But some large airlines including Etihad, Malaysia Airlines and India's Jet Airways confirmed they did not carry electric stun guns.</p><p>And sources at other global carriers, including Emirates and Lufthansa, also said they were not part of standard on-board kit, although the airlines did not officially confirm this.</p><p>However, most airlines do carry equipment to restrain disruptive passengers including ropes, cuffs and adhesive tape.</p><p>There is some risk to using Tasers or other similar stun guns, although this tends to revolve around the harm to those hit by them.</p><p>In the UK, there have been at least 17 deaths linked to the use of stun guns since they were introduced by police in 2003.</p><p>And while not ideal to use one on a plane, there is not thought to be any great risk to the safety of a plane if a Taser was activated.</p><p>Bear in mind that proponents of air marshals (see below) argue that even when using regular gunfire on a flight - the level of risk is manageable.</p><p>Unruly behaviour on aircraft is a growing problem according to a study by IATA, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37503112" class="story-body__link">with a sharp rise of incidents in 2015.</a></p><p>Incidents of people getting in fights, being verbally abusive or refusing to follow cabin crew orders were up by 17%.</p><p>Alcohol or drug use was identified as a factor in one-in-four incidents.</p><p>In 11% of cases, there was physical aggression or even damage to the aircraft.</p><p>Some 10,854 incidents of passengers disrupting flights were reported to IATA last year, up from 9,316 incidents in 2014. That's one incident for every 1,205 flights.</p><p>An air marshal is an undercover armed guard on board a commercial aircraft, to counter hijackings and other hostile acts.</p><p>In the event of an imminent threat from a passenger, air marshals say they are trained to respond with lethal force.</p><p>Their use was ramped up, especially in the US, after the 11 September 2001 attacks.</p><p>It is thought there are now several thousand marshals employed by the US Department for Homeland Security, compared with the 33 flying regularly pre-9/11.</p><p>Israel's El Al has had armed marshals operating on its flights for more than 30 years.</p>
