<p>In this week's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b088fx3g" class="story-body__link">In Business</a> on BBC Radio 4, I spoke to historians, economists, nurses, doctors and other healthcare staff to try to get to the bottom of these questions. </p><p>And to pose another one - does the NHS have the right mix of staff with the right mix of skills or could changing traditional roles rather than just boosting numbers help?  </p><p>The Royal College of Nurses says England is currently short of at least 20,000 nursing staff.  </p><p>And the Royal College of Midwives says the country needs 3,500 more midwives. </p><p>Meanwhile, GP leaders and the Royal College of Emergency Medicine say the UK urgently needs greater numbers of general practitioners and emergency doctors - just a few of the medical specialities struggling with recruitment and retention right now.</p><p>Increasingly, an older population, with often complex health needs, adds extra demand. </p><p>But these problems are far from new. </p><p>Stephanie Snow, medical historian at the University of Manchester, says staff shortages have existed since the very birth of the NHS, in 1948 - though people are often quick to label recruitment crises as one-off problems. </p><p>She told the BBC: "Over the first decade in particular, the NHS expanded its specialist services rapidly and there were many new technologies on board.</p><p>"All of these things led to unprecedented increases in the number of staff required. </p><p>"By the time we get to the late 1960s, hospitals had to turn to mass recruitment, looking towards countries such as India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka - where courses were taught in English and aligned to the UK's General Medical Council, as a consequence of colonial rule."</p><p>Meanwhile, Anita Charlesworth, director of Research and Economics at the think tank, the Health Foundation, argues the UK has perpetually trained lower numbers of medical and nursing students than it needs.</p><p>She said: "There is not a problem that we don't have enough bright, young people who would meet the standards and would love to have a career in medicine and nursing. </p><p>"They just can't get a place. We have systematically trained fewer than we need."</p><p>And she suggests being able to recruit doctors and nurses from overseas has offered a "get out of jail card" for successive staff shortages. </p><p>Dr Mark Porter, of the doctors' union, the British Medical Association, argues we have generally staffed a health service we can afford - rather than look at what the population needs. </p><p>But he says planning for the NHS workforce of the future is not easy. </p><p>He said: "It is difficult to get planning perfect for every one of 50 or 60 specialities all of the time. </p><p>"The population's needs are genuinely not quite as predictable as one might imagine. </p><p>"We know the trajectory illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes are taking over the next five years.</p><p>"But what about the next 25 years? </p><p>"Will public health messages and new technology be successful, or won't they? </p><p>"The answer could give us completely different trajectories in the future."</p><p>For its part, the government says it plans to increase the numbers of doctors and nurses it trains and boost other healthcare staff too.</p><p>At the Conservative Party conference in October 2016, Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, said: "My job is to prepare the NHS for the future, and that means doing something today that we have never done properly before, and that's training enough doctors."</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37546360" class="story-body__link">The government announced</a> there would be up to an extra 1,500 medical school places each year from 2018 in England. </p><p>And, looking back, the NHS Confederation said there had been an extra 32,467 doctors employed in England in 2014 compared with 2004.</p><p>Meanwhile, nurse numbers increased by 18,432. </p><p>Health chiefs also say current plans to scrap nurse bursaries will help increase the number of nurse training places available this year - though whether this will work in practice is unclear and has been disputed by nursing leaders. </p><p>Other positions such as nurse apprentices and physician associates are being explored. </p><p>Physician associates (PAs) - trained to do some of the jobs junior doctors do, might be able to cut some pressures on wards. </p><p>But current numbers are tiny, most cannot prescribe and they are not professionally regulated in the same way doctors are.</p><p>Ms Charlesworth is worried options for filling shortages quickly might be running out. </p><p>She said: "There's a massive gap globally now in the number of doctors and nurses compared to projected demand. </p><p>"So India keeps many more of its doctors. </p><p>"It has fantastic leading hospitals that are an exciting place to work if you are a young Indian doctor. </p><p>"There is a global shortage of clinical healthcare staff." </p><p>And of course there is another issue to consider. </p><p><a href="http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7783#fullreport" class="story-body__link-external">It is estimated </a>about 10% doctors and 7% of nurses working in the NHS in England are nationals of other EU countries. </p><p>The question is - could Brexit make NHS recruitment and retention problems even worse? </p><p><i>To find out more and to hear some possible solutions, listen to: BBC Radio 4 - In Business, </i><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b088fx3g" class="story-body__link">The NHS- The Recruitment Dilemma</a><i>. </i></p>
