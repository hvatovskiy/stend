<p>Anthony Joshua, an International Boxing Federation (IBF) heavyweight champion, tweeted on Tuesday the photo of himself and his friends praying. It has since been retweeted more than 18,000 times.</p>
<p>Joshua, who won gold at the London 2012 Olympics, wrote "prayer was a solid foundation" alongside hard work, luck, and talent, in the tweet accompanying the picture.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Besides luck, hard work & talent.. Prayer is a solid foundation. It was nice to join my brother as he led through afternoon prayer (asr) 🙏🏾 <a href="https://t.co/KJ4f2lu3mP"> pic.twitter.com/KJ4f2lu3mP </a></p>

<p>Joshua was raised a Christian but follows no particular religion, according to an interview he did with the British news agency, the Press Association, last year.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many on Twitter vented anger at him for associating himself with Islam.</p>
<p>"He is a great fighter but I am shocked and disappointed by his support for such a vile religion," wrote one person with the username 'RightWingRoy'.</p>
<p>Another user, Sam Halpin, wrote "You have lost my support and i hope klitscho (sic) irons you out", referring to Joshua's upcoming bout with Ukrainian boxer Vitali Klitschko.</p>

<p>The negative response, however, soon gave way to messages of support for Joshua and others mocking the significance of Twitter users withdrawing their support for a famous sportsman.</p>
<p>"People abusing Anthony Joshua for visiting a Mosque probably paid tribute to Muhammad Ali when he died last year," said ring announcer Ricky Wright.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This don is hating on Anthony Joshua for praying at a mosque. He spent £70 on a Pogba shirt but does this clown know Pogba is Muslim???? 😂😂 <a href="https://t.co/VV1ubjw35R"> pic.twitter.com/VV1ubjw35R </a></p>

<p>"Question the society we live in when people are moaning over #AnthonyJoshua in a mosque. Get a grip of yourselves seriously!" said another user named Aubrey.</p>
<p>The Twitter storm comes amid rising far-right and populist sentiment across the Western world, with a lot of angry rhetoric aimed at Islam and Muslims.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Anthony Joshua is absolutely gutted that derek, 32 from slough is unfollowing him because he's a Muslim. Absolutely gutted</p>

<p>In the US, President-elect Donald Trump has promised to ban Muslims from entering the country, while in France, the leader of the far-right Front National, Marine Le Pen, has emerged as a front-runner in this year's presidential election.</p>
