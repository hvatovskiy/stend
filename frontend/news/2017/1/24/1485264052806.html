<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Avigdor Liberman accepted the latest settlement plans on Tuesday, The Jerusalem Post reported.</p>
<p>Most of the planned units will be built in existing settlement blocs, it added.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Israeli authorities approved the construction of 566 settler homes in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>This announcement came shortly after the inauguration of Donald Trump in the United States, with Israeli official saying the permits had been held up until the end of Barack Obama's administration, which had been critical of Israeli settlement activity.</p>
<p>"The rules of the game have changed with Donald Trump's arrival as president," Meir Turgeman, Jerusalem's deputy mayor, told AFP news agency.</p>
<p>"We no longer have our hands tied as in the time of Barack Obama. Now we can finally build."</p>
<p>Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian territory are illegal under international law and Palestinian officials condemn them.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span>Â <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
