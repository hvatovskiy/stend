<p><strong>The claim: </strong>The government is announcing a cash boost for the North of England.</p><p><strong>Reality Check verdict: </strong>The money has already been announced twice. </p><p>On Monday, she held a cabinet meeting in Daresbury in Cheshire, where she unveiled her new, more interventionist industrial strategy.</p><p>Details on where exactly the Northern Powerhouse cash will be spent are new, but the £556m total is not.</p><p>Last March, George Osborne said a total of £1.8bn would be awarded in a round of "growth deal" funding to Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) across England.  </p><p>LEPs combine businesses, councils and other bodies to decide regional spending priorities, on things like city centre regeneration projects and innovation funds for businesses.</p><p>It is part of a wider scheme aimed at boosting the post-Brexit UK economy and creating jobs, with a particular focus on investment in science, research and innovation.</p><p>Mr Osborne's replacement, Philip Hammond, announced in November that £556m of this pot would go to the North of England. It was announced again in the Autumn Statement later that month.</p><p>As well as the North's share, Mr Hammond allocated £492m to London and the South East, £392m to the Midlands, and smaller amounts to other regions. </p><p>Northern leaders say their cities are stuck with weak economies because of underinvestment, while the South East takes the lion's share of public cash.</p><p>The government says the Northern Powerhouse will go some way to rectifying the imbalance. In this case the North of England is getting 13% more than London and the South East.</p><p>But other areas of government spending favour London over the North.</p><p>The capital will receive six times more money on transport spending per person over the next five years, according to <a href="http://www.ippr.org/news-and-media/press-releases/transport-secretary-urged-to-close-1-600-per-person-london-north-spending-gap" class="story-body__link-external">research by the Institute for Public Policy Research.</a></p>
