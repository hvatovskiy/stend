<p>While legislative efforts take time, a swipe of the pen from the White House can often enact broad changes in government policy and practice. </p><p>President Donald Trump has wasted little time in taking advantage of this privilege. </p><p>Given his predecessor's reliance on executive orders to circumvent Congress in the later days of his presidency, he has a broad range of areas in which to flex his muscle. </p><p>Here's a look at some of what Mr Trump has done so far:</p><p>In one of his first actions as president, Mr Trump issued a multi-paragraph directive to the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies involved in managing the nation's healthcare system.</p><p>The order states that agencies must "waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay" any portions of the Affordable Care Act that creates financial burden on states, individuals or healthcare providers. </p><p>Although the order technically does not authorise any powers the executive agencies do not already have, it's viewed as a clear signal that the Trump administration will be rolling back Obama-era healthcare regulations wherever possible.</p><p>What's called the Mexico City policy, first implemented in 1984 under Republican President Ronald Reagan, prevents foreign non-governmental organisations that receive any US cash from "providing counselling or referrals for abortion or advocating for access to abortion services in their country". </p><p>The ban, derided as a "global gag rule" by its critics, has been the subject of a political tug-of-war ever since its inception, with every Democratic president rescinding the measure, and every Republican bringing it back. </p><p>Anti-abortion activists expected Mr Trump to act quickly on this - and he didn't disappoint them.</p><p>On Mr Trump's first full workday in the White House he issued a directive to federal agencies to halt any new government hiring.</p><p>He told reporters who had gathered for the signing that the freeze would not affect military spending.</p><p>The directive is part of Mr Trump's effort to reduce government debts and decrease the size of the federal workforce.</p><p>During his campaign, he frequently railed against government bureaucracy, and vowed to "drain the swamp" of corrupt governance. </p><p>The Trans-Pacific Partnership, once viewed as the crown jewel of Barack Obama's international trade policy, was a regular punching bag for Mr Trump on the campaign trail (although he at times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-rand-paul-trump-china-trade-deal-20151110-htmlstory.html" class="story-body__link-external">seemed uncertain</a> about what nations were actually involved).</p><p>The deal was never approved by Congress so it had yet to go into effect in the US.</p>
