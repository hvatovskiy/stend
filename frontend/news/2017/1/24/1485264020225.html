<p>Boys aged five to 16 get on average £10.70 a week made up from pocket money, a paid job or paid chores. Girls are on £8.50 a week, data suggests.</p><p>The survey of 2,000 UK children by researchers Childwise also found boys were given more financial independence.</p><p>Parents were teaching girls and boys differently about money, it found.</p><p>The majority of children receive some sort of regular weekly payment, typically pocket money from their parents, data suggested. Only one in five had a paid job.</p><p>Researchers found that the difference between girls and boys' allowance becomes wider the older they get.</p><p>Boys aged 11 to 16 were on £17.80, while girls of the same age were on £12.50, a gap of £5.30.</p><p>Childwise research manager Jenny Ehren said: "The data points towards an early gender imbalance in the way parents educate their children about money matters and financial independence.</p><p>"Boys are more likely to be entrusted with regular cash payments, while girls are more reliant on other people buying them items, or managing money on their behalf."</p><p>She added that girls appeared to have less financial freedom than boys. </p><p>"They are more likely to have things bought for them, including expensive items such as clothes and footwear, and lower cost purchases such as toiletries, hair products and makeup," said Ms Ehren.</p><p>These extra purchases helped to bridge the income gap between boys and girls, but the approach to managing money matters was "noticeably different", she added.</p><p>The most popular pocket money purchase was sweets and chocolate, followed closely by crisps, snacks, soft drinks and going out, the survey found.</p>
