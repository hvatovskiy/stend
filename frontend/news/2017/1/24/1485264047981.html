The case went to the Supreme Court in December but <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38720320" class="story-body__link">the 11 judges rejected the government's appeal by a majority of eight to three</a>.</p><p>Speaking after the High Court verdict, Ms Miller told the BBC the case was about scrutinising the details of Brexit, such as "how we leave, how they're going to negotiate, the directions of travel the government will take".  </p><p>Ms Miller added that the challenge was about more than Brexit.</p><p>"It is about any government, any prime minister, in the future being able to take away people's rights without consulting Parliament," she said.</p><p>"We cannot have a democracy like that. That isn't a democracy, that is verging on dictatorship."</p><p>She has described herself as neither a leave nor a remain campaigner.</p><p>Asked whether she was "a remainer to your boots", she told BBC's Andrew Marr Show she had campaigned for "remain, reform and review" during the referendum.</p><p>But she said the case was now not about the referendum result, but "how we leave the EU".</p><p>She told the then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage on the programme that "everyone in the country" should be her "biggest fan" following the controversial court case.</p><p>"This is about creating legal certainty and actually, everyone in the country should be my biggest fan because I've used my own money and a few of us we have used our own money to create legal certainty for Mrs May to move ahead."</p><p>Some newspapers have focused on Ms Miller's private life. However, she said "everyone has a past" and it was "totally irrelevant" to the importance of the case.</p><p>She has also spoken about the abuse she suffered as a result of her legal battle.</p><p>"I was aware there would be nastiness because anything to do with the word Brexit, people lose their minds and it's all about heart. Actually it is about your head and your heart."</p><p>She told BBC Radio 5 live she plans to report online trolls to police after receiving rape and beheading threats.</p><p>In December, a  55-year-old man from Swindon <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38237517" class="story-body__link">was arrested over alleged threats</a> against Ms Miller. He was later released on bail.</p><p>She told the BBC's Clive Coleman that a discussion with the police concluded that employing security would be "sensible" during the Supreme Court hearing.</p><p>She also told the Andrew Marr Show she was appalled by fierce criticism by the newspapers of the High Court judges who ruled on the case.</p><p>The Daily Mail branded the judges "Enemies of the people", while the Daily Express said the ruling had marked "the day democracy died".</p><p>Ms Miller said "that is unforgivable", saying she is "a nobody and they are "the biggest brains in this country". </p>
