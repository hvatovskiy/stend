<p>People in Westport are up in arms over late-night landline calls intended for the UK-based station.</p><p>The mix-up is a result of Irish viewers calling the show's premium-rate numbers, which start with 098, without adding the international dialling code.</p><p>Regional Development Minister Michael Ring said his constituents were "aggravated and annoyed".</p><p>Mr Ring told the Sunday Independent: "They are getting these calls in the middle of night. </p><p>"One of those people has an elderly mother and family members all over the world and there could be a call at any time that they would have to take."</p><p>He said people in the town should not have to change their phone number because of the blunder.</p><p>The Fine Gael politician has referred the matter to a number of authorities, including the police, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) and ComReg, the Republic of Ireland's communications sector regulator.</p><p>The minister told the paper the police "did everything they could" but they had limited powers.</p><p>BAI chief executive Michael O'Keeffe said it had contacted Babestation on behalf of one complainant and spoken to a representative about the issue.</p><p>"It is unfortunate that this issue is still continuing," he added.</p><p>"However, the BAI is not in a position to address the problem as it is not within our remit and he was advised at all times we were assisting him as a matter of courtesy."</p><p>A spokeswoman for ComReg said it had been in contact with its UK counterpart and it was trying to "identify a solution as soon as possible".</p><p>"ComReg advises anyone calling the UK from the Republic of Ireland should always use the prefix 00 44," she said.</p><p>Mr Ring has also contacted the Phone-paid Services Authority (PSA), the UK regulator for goods and services charged to a phone bill, such as directory enquiries and votes to TV talent shows.</p>
