<p>Rob had been warned by social services that the boy he was adopting could be difficult, but nothing prepared him for what came next. </p><p>"He was violent towards my wife, so she got kicked and thumped," he said.</p><p>"There was quite a lot of emotional abuse to her as well - and this was from a four-, five-year-old kid.  </p><p>"My wife now shows the sort of symptoms of someone who's suffered domestic abuse."</p><p>Rob, not his real name, and his wife had children of their own, but decided to adopt three more. </p><p>He told the BBC's  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05qqk5c" class="story-body__link">Victoria Derbyshire programme</a> that one of them had rejected their affections and attempts to love him.   </p><p>He also said had the family been given more support, then the situation might have been different - but funding for specialist therapies has been cut. </p><p>Rob said he ended up with "quite serious" depression, and almost lost his job because he took a lot of time off work. </p><p>Finally, the situation became untenable and the boy was taken back into care. </p><p>Rob described this as the hardest thing he had ever had to do.</p><p>"For us it felt like failure," he said.</p><p>"It felt like letting this kid down. And how can you do that to your own son, whom you really love? It's heartbreaking."</p><p>It can take anything from six months to two years to adopt a child, but not all new relationships are successful.  </p><p>National statistics do not exist, but it is estimated that between 3.2% and 9% of adoptions fail, with the child either being taken back into care, or leaving the family home.  </p><p>The charity Adoption UK thinks as many as a quarter of all adoptive families are in crisis and in need of professional help to keep the family unit together.</p><p>Specialist therapy is available for adoptive children, to help them settle with their new family. </p><p>However, such therapy is expensive and even though adoptive parents in England have access to the Adoption Support Fund, it does not always cover the costs.  </p><p>The fund was set up in 2015 so that parents, via their local authorities, could apply for financial support for specialist therapy.</p><p>But demand outstripped expectations, and in October 2016 the government announced the fund would be capped at £5,000 per child. </p><p>Julie Selwyn, professor of child and family social work at the University of Bristol, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/301889/Final_Report_-_3rd_April_2014v2.pdf" class="story-body__link-external">has written a report about adoption breakdown.</a></p><p>She said many of these specialist interventions needed more than "one-off therapy". </p><p>"It needs to be ongoing, and it will often cost a lot more than £5,000," she said.</p><p>Prof Selwyn also said children who were older when they were placed with a new family were far more likely to suffer disruptions.     </p><p>"It's whether they want to be adopted when they're older and how long they've been exposed to adversity in their lives," she said.   </p><p>"What they've often learnt is that adults aren't very caring and that adults can't meet their needs, so they find it hard to trust new parents."</p><p>One woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said the two children she had adopted had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.  </p><p>"A therapy plan was put together, but then we were told about the new funding cap and that won't even cover the cost of the initial assessment," she said</p><p>"The therapy for our two children has been priced at £30,000. We are devastated."</p><p>Liz, not her real name, adopted two sisters. The eldest was nine and never settled. </p><p>"The anger was off the scale really," Liz said.</p><p>"I lost my business because of the stress and in a way, you feel a sort of bitterness - not towards your daughter, but because of the system."</p><p>Liz's elder daughter moved out when she was 16. </p><p>Now 18 and a mother herself, she is still in touch with her adoptive parents, but said she had struggled to accept them.  </p><p>"It was difficult, because it was a change, especially at nine years old," she said,</p><p>"It was strange, because you've got new parents.   </p><p>"It was mainly difficult with my adoptive mum. </p><p>"We clashed, because I didn't really let go of what I do remember as a child with my biological family."</p><p>There are about 87,000 children in care in the UK, and every year about 5,500 are adopted.  </p><p>These are often the most vulnerable, with no chance of returning to their birth families.  </p><p>The government said it was committed to helping adoptive parents and their children. </p><p>The Department of Education said the Adoption Support Fund's budget had been increased from £19m to £23m and that the government planned to increase the fund's budget in every year of this Parliament. </p><p>It also said capping the funds available allowed more families to benefit.</p><p>But some parents questioned the logic of reducing access to early therapy.  </p><p>Rob's adopted son is now looked after by two full-time carers, at great expense to his local authority. </p><p>He said that if they had had help sooner, it could have benefitted everyone.</p><p>"We had such high hopes for what we could give," he said.</p><p>"And the saddest bit is that we gave everything we had, but the people we thought were going to back us up just weren't there."</p>
