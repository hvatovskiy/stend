<p>He says it's about protecting US citizens and preventing what he calls terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>His executive order recalls the September 11 attacks in 2001, when passenger jets flew into New York's Twin Towers.</p>
<p>But the 19 hijackers on those planes were from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE, and Lebanon - none of the countries on Trump's banned list.</p>
<p>So how can the US president justify his order? And where does it leave Muslims living in the United States?</p>
