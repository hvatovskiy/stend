<p>This year will be the last Women's Prize for Fiction has the word Baileys attached to it. </p><p>The liqueur company, owned by Diageo, said it had <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38768553" class="story-body__link">"regretfully decided to make way for a new sponsor".</a></p><p>Orange sponsored the award for 17 years up to 2012 before Baileys took over in 2014.</p><p>The shifting nature of commercial partnerships means that book prizes can often change their names every few years. </p><p>It can just be a minor tweak - such as a simple change of prefix.  </p><p>But sometimes well-known prize names can be rendered suddenly unrecognisable.</p><p>Up until 2015 the the most prestigious non-fiction prize was known as the <strong>Samuel Johnson Prize</strong>. </p><p>In 2016 it became the <strong>Baillie Gifford Prize </strong>to reflect a new sponsorship deal.  </p><p>First awarded in 1999, it has also been known as the <strong>BBC Four Samuel Johnson Prize</strong> and then the <strong>BBC Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Costa Book Awards</strong> started out as <strong>the Whitbread Awards </strong>in 1971 and only became known by their current name in 2006. The overall 2017 winner is announced this week. </p><p>The best-known literary prize of them all, the <strong>Man Booker Prize</strong>, was founded by the Booker McConnell company in 1968. Investment company Man Group began its sponsorship in 2002 and retained Booker in the official title.</p><p><strong>The Folio Prize </strong>is a new kid on the block in terms of book awards.</p><p>It was first announced as the Literature Prize in 2011 amid a row about the decision by Man Booker Prizes judges that year to focus on "readability".</p><p>It was the first major English language book prize open to writers from around the world.</p><p>Under the sponsorship of The Folio Society, its first Â£40,000 accolade was handed out in 2014.  After the 2015 award, the Folio Society announced that it would not renew its partnership.</p><p>The prize took a year off in 2016 while it searched for a new sponsor and is back in 2017 as the <strong>Rathbones Folio Prize</strong>, with backing from Rathbone Investment Management.</p><p>Andrew Kidd, co-founder of the Folio Prize and of digital book club Alexi, knows all about the challenge of changing sponsor.</p><p>"We are a very young prize and we are still building public awareness," he says. "We haven't established ourselves enough to say we have a right to exist. We were born out of a particular moment."</p><p>During its year off it was decided to open the fiction prize to any literary genre, including non-fiction. </p><p>Mr Kidd says the search for a new sponsor wasn't as hard as he had expected.  </p><p>"Because we waited until we had our own USP [Unique Selling Point] it was not that difficult at all. We had a compelling story to tell."</p><p>This year's winner will be announced on 24 May, with the Egyptian author Ahdaf Soueif as chair of the judging panel.</p><p>Its co-founder, novelist Kate Mosse, is, as you might expect, optimistic. </p><p>"We feel very confident about attracting a new sponsor," she told the BBC. </p><p>"We know that brands want to be associated with something that's inspirational... and we know customers like to be involved with companies that have some sort of social purpose."</p><p>Mr Kidd agrees: "Even when it was the Orange Prize everybody knew what it was. They've been so successful at building that unique brand that I would imagine it will be relatively easy to find a sponsor."</p><p>He said that having such a high profile advocate in Kate Mosse also puts them in a strong position.</p><p>"There's no question that there's an important place for a prize that focuses on female voices," he added. </p><p>"I would imagine that a lot of sponsors will be interested in associating themselves with something that has such a strong purpose." </p>
