<p>Isle of Wight Council tried to fine Jon Platt £120 for taking his daughter to Florida during the school term.</p><p>But magistrates backed the father, so the council appealed to the High Court, which again ruled in Mr Platt's favour.</p><p>The Department for Education is meeting the council's legal costs. </p><p>The legal case rests on what constitutes "regular attendance". </p><p>Mr Platt has argued that even after the "once-in-a-lifetime" family trip to Disneyland, his daughter had 90% attendance at school <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36277940" class="story-body__link">and this argument was accepted by the High Court in May last year. </a></p><p>At the time Lord Justice Lloyd Jones said the case "raised a point of law of general public importance". </p><p>After losing the case the council, at the request of Schools Minister Nick Gibb, applied to the Supreme Court for permission to launch a final legal challenge.</p><p>New guidelines came into force in England in 2013 making the policy on unauthorised term-time absences the toughest in the UK. </p><p>The change followed concerns that some families had started to see going away in term-time as an entitlement. </p><p>Under the rules, if a school declares an absence unauthorised, the council can fine each parent £60 per child - and this doubles to £120 if not paid within 21 days. </p><p>Councils in England have varying policies on term-time holiday fines.  Some issue thousands of fines - others barely any. </p><p>The case is forcing many to look again at the detail. </p><p>Most parents simply pay the fines to avoid prosecution, but  Mr Platt says thousands have contacted him for advice on fighting the fines. </p><p>Many parents complain that the cost of going away in the school holidays can be four times as much as during term-time - but the government says there is clear evidence "that every extra day of school missed can affect a pupil's chance of gaining good GCSEs, which has a lasting effect on their life chances".</p><p>A DfE spokeswoman said the government's position remained that children should not be taken out of school "without good reason". </p><p>"That is why we have tightened the rules and are supporting schools and local authorities to use their powers to tackle unauthorised absence."</p><p>Ministers are also considering changing the law on term-time absences, depending on the outcome of the case. </p>
