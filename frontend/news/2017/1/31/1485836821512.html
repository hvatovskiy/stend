<p>Saeed was taken into custody at the headquarters for Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), the religious charity he heads, late on Monday, a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>"He has been arrested, and he is being taken in police custody to his home," Nadeem Awan told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>Awan added that dozens of JuD supporters were accompanying the police convoy to Saeed's home.</p>
<p class="ReadMoreContentSeparator"><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/06/us-blacklists-pakistani-islamic-charity-20146261127191358.html" target="_self"> READ MORE: US blacklists Pakistan's Jamaat-ud-Dawa </a></p>
<p>In 2012, the US placed a $10m bounty for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Saeed, who is also the founder of armed group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).</p>
<p>Saeed has long since distanced himself from LeT, which has claimed responsibility for several attacks on Indian security forces and civilians, saying he now only runs <span>JuD </span>as a charity. </p>
<p>The United Nations and the United States, however, list JuD as a front for LeT. Both organisations, in addition to Saeed as an individual, remain under international sanctions.</p>
<p>Saeed has been accused by both the US and India of masterminding the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which killed 166 people in attacks across India's largest city.</p>
<p>LeT has been banned as a "terrorist" organisation by Pakistan since 2002. In 2008, JuD was listed by Pakistan under a list of organisations subject to UN sanctions, including an assets freeze, arms embargo and international travel ban.</p>
<p>The group <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2015/05/sanctions-pakistan-terrorists-thrive-150518065848142.html">continues to work openly</a> across Pakistan, however, running a network of seminaries, releasing several publications and carrying out widespread humanitarian aid work.</p>
<p>"We have never broken any laws of this country. If they have a legal order, then we will follow the law, and the doors of the court are available to us to seek justice," said Awan, shortly before Saeed's detention.<br> <br>Four other men - Abdullah Ubaid, Zafar Iqbal, Abdur Rehman Abid and Qazi Kashif Niaz - are also to be detained under the government's detention orders, local media reported, citing copies and footage of the detention orders.<br> <br>The men are being detained under Section 11-EEE of Pakistan's Anti-Terrorism Act, which gives the government the power to arrest or detain "terrorism" suspects for up to 12 months.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera News</span></p>
