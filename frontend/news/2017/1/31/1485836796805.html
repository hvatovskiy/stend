<p>Assistant Chief Constable Rebekah Sutcliffe, 47, told temporary Supt Sarah Jackson she would "always just be known as the girl who had the tit job".</p><p>In December, a disciplinary panel ruled the Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officer had breached standards of professional behaviour.</p><p>But Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling ruled she could keep her job.</p><p>Ms Sutcliffe told Ms Jackson - who has since transferred to Cumbria Police - her "credibility was zero", she was as a "laughing stock" and that she was "silly, vain and frivolous" for going under the knife.</p><p>She is alleged to have said: "It does not matter how hard you work now, because you will always just be known as the girl who had the tit job."</p><p>She then pulled down the front of her dress to expose her left breast and said: "Look at these, look at these, these are the breasts of someone who has had three children.</p><p>"They are ugly, but I don't feel the need to pump myself full of silicone to get self-esteem."</p><p>The panel heard Ms Sutcliffe made repeated attempts to apologise to Ms Jackson the following day and told her she "deeply regretted" it. </p><p>She later said she was "frazzled" and had been drinking too much to cope with stress in her personal and professional life.</p><p>The panel stated her gross misconduct had taken her to the "very" brink of dismissal, but accepted it was out of character and recommended a final written warning.</p><p>The officers were attending a Senior Women In Policing conference at Manchester's Hilton Hotel when Ms Sutcliffe verbally attacked her colleague.</p><p>Ms Sutcliffe, who was the most senior female GMP officer at the time, had admitted misconduct but denied gross misconduct.</p><p>Her counsel, John Beggs QC, had handed the panel more than 200 pages of testimonials, with many officers speaking of Ms Sutcliffe as "inspirational", "visionary" and "a strong leader".</p><p>Announcing his decision to follow the panel's recommendation, Mr Pilling said: "Despite being absolutely appalled at her behaviour and all too aware of the damage to public confidence, I do not think I can take a different view without any significant reason to do so."</p><p>Following the decision, Ms Sutcliffe expressed "deep regret" about what happened and said the "responsibility for what happened is mine and mine alone". </p><p>"I did not mean any of the things that I said and I am dismayed that I was so unkind and unfair," she added.</p><p>"I am very grateful that I have been given the opportunity to return to work.</p><p>"On my return, I will bring the very best of my abilities to serve policing and the public as well as I am able."</p><p>Ian Hopkins, chief constable of GMP, said it had been "an incredibly difficult time" for the police service, where "the events in May... cast a shadow over what was an important event to recognise the contribution of women in policing".</p><p>"The details in the report have clearly outlined the panel's position and legally left little alternative but to follow the panel's recommendation."</p><p>He added: "ACC Sutcliffe has been given a chance to demonstrate that she is committed to serving the people of Greater Manchester. </p>
