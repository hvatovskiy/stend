<p>Sara Connor, 46, and David Taylor, 34, are both charged with murdering Wayan Sudarsa on Bali's Kuta beach last year.</p><p>Mr Taylor has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-38726948" class="story-body__link">admitted he hit Mr Sudarsa</a> with items including binoculars and a beer bottle.</p><p>Ms Connor told the Denpasar District Court on Monday she believed Mr Taylor was acting in self-defence.</p><p>"I believe David is not an aggressive man," she said. "He was defending himself."</p><p>Both Ms Connor and Mr Taylor face up to 15 years in jail if they are found guilty of murder. </p><p>The court heard Ms Connor and Mr Taylor were enjoying a night on the beach on 16 August when they became aware her handbag was missing, and separated to search for it.</p><p>Mr Taylor has said he approached Mr Sudarsa believing the policeman may have stolen the bag, and the encounter escalated into a fight.</p><p>Ms Connor on Monday said she spotted Mr Taylor on top of a man and tried to separate them. She claimed she fled the scuffle after Mr Sudarsa pulled her hair and bit her on the leg.</p><p>The court heard Ms Connor did not ask questions when Mr Taylor told her he had left the man "passed out" on the beach.</p><p>Ms Connor said she later "panicked" when she learnt Mr Sudarsa was dead. The court heard the pair burnt clothes they were wearing on the night. </p><p>Asked why she destroyed evidence, Ms Connor said: "I am still not guilty and look where I am. It was the panic of being in a distant country, not understanding the language."</p><p>Outside court, Mr Taylor told reporters he was happy that Ms Connor "told the truth".</p>
