<p>Top-flight clubs have already paid out over &pound;150m and a final flurry of activity could see the total spend pass the &pound;225m mark of January 2011.</p><p>Players may be leaving rather than joining the top sides, with Chelsea keeper Asmir Begovic and Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho perhaps moving.</p><p>The transfer window closes at 23:00 GMT in both England and Scotland.</p><p>You can follow all the deals and Tuesday's seven Premier League fixtures across the BBC on TV, radio, online, the BBC Sport app and social media.</p><p><i>BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty</i></p><p>January's transfer window is traditionally less hectic and with less quality on offer than August - but that does not mean Tuesday will be calm rather than chaotic.</p><p>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp will be low key on incomings but one of the biggest deals of the day may yet be an Anfield outgoing, with Liverpool still hoping to secure nearly &pound;20m for outcast France defender Sakho.</p><p>The 26-year-old has drawn interest from Premier League rivals Southampton, Spanish side Sevilla and Turkish club Galatasaray - but word from inside Anfield is that this one could go down to the wire.</p><p>Chelsea may see some departures as the day progresses, with Bosnia goalkeeper Begovic the subject of a &pound;12m bid from fellow Premier League side Bournemouth and veteran defender Branislav Ivanovic wanted by Russian club Zenit St Petersburg.</p><p>Begovic's departure will depend on the league leaders signing a replacement, so will they further pursue their interest in <a href="/sport/football/38794447">Craig Gordon from Scottish champions Celtic?</a></p><p>Southampton may be consolidated in the Premier League and in the EFL Cup final against Manchester United, but manager Claude Puel is in the market for attacking reinforcements with Napoli's Manolo Gabbiadini in his sights.</p><p>Gabbiadini was a target for Everton last summer only for a deal to fall down. His recent form does not inspire confidence, but the <a href="/sport/football/38803640">Saints have agreed a fee of about &pound;14m for the player,</a> who is set to have a medical on Tuesday.</p><p>Down at the bottom of the table, Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce says he has been trying to sign between 20 and 30 players - and could David Moyes be tempted to test Everton boss Ronald Koeman's resolve to keep his former captain Phil Jagielka at Goodison Park?</p><p>Koeman is a firm admirer of Burnley's fine young defender Michael Keane but faces a tough task prising him out of Turf Moor by close of play on Tuesday. This is one that might have to wait until the summer.</p><p>West Ham United are in the mood to spend some of the &pound;25m they reluctantly accepted from <a href="/sport/football/38675958">Marseille for Dimitri Payet</a> - so expect them to head in the direction of Brentford for &pound;15m-rated striker Scott Hogan.</p><p>The race for promotion from the Championship may also spark some high-profile deals.</p><p>Newcastle United would like Everton's James McCarthy, but a &pound;20m price tag and reluctance to sell makes that a tough deal for Magpies boss Rafael Benitez.</p><p>Will Benitez also pursue a return to St James' Park for winger Andros Townsend, such a success on Tyneside last season but seemingly not to Allardyce's liking at Selhurst Park?</p><p>Goals will make a difference in that division, so someone may be tempted to overlook Ross McCormack's attitude - so heavily criticised by Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce - and take a chance on his goalscoring.</p><p>And if Bruce can sell McCormack, it would be no surprise to see him direct some of the cash towards Middlesbrough's out-of-favour Scotland international Jordan Rhodes.</p><p>The names may not be A-List - but there are still potentially plenty of big deals to provide the usual ration of deadline day excitement.</p><p><b>Online</b></p><p>Our transfer deadline day live text commentary gets under way at 08:00 GMT and you can access it from your computer, tablet or mobile via the BBC Sport website or app.</p><p>We will bring you the latest news, analysis, gossip and done deals from our reporters around the country and worldwide.</p><p>You will also be able to have your say as the transfers are completed.</p><p><a href="/sport/38482984">Our transfers page</a> will capture every confirmed move, while each club page will be updated with the latest transfer stories.</p><p>Later, we will have three separate live pages for all of the Premier League, English Football League and Scottish Premiership action.</p><p><b>Social media</b></p><p>You will be able to follow all the deadline-day deals via BBC Sport's Twitter account and share your views using <a class="sp-story-body__external-link" href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23bbcdeadlineday&amp;src=typd">#bbcdeadlineday.<i class="sp-story-body__external-link-icon gelicon gelicon--external" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></p><p>There will also be the opportunity to give your reaction on the <a class="sp-story-body__external-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCSport/">BBC Sport<i class="sp-story-body__external-link-icon gelicon gelicon--external" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and <a class="sp-story-body__external-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCMOTD/">Match of the Day Facebook<i class="sp-story-body__external-link-icon gelicon gelicon--external" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> pages.</p><p><b>Radio</b></p><p>There will be regular transfer updates on the BBC's national and regional radio stations.</p><p>On BBC Radio 5 live, Mark Chapman hosts a specially extended edition of 5 live Sport that will not only keep up with all the transfer news, but also bring you live commentary of Liverpool v Chelsea and all the goals as they go in from the <a href="/sport/football/38795127">other six Premier League matches.</a></p><p>The show will be on the air from 19:00-23:00 GMT.
