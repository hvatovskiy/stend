<p><span>Two other candidates, Botswana's Foreign Minister Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi, and Mba Mokuy, of Equatorial Guinea, also contested for the seat.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The 56-year-old and father-of-five </span><span>succeeds South Africa's Nkosazana <span>Dlamini-</span>Zuma, the first woman to lead the bloc of 54 states, who did not seek a second term in office after completing a four-year term.</span></span></p>
<p>Kenya was the first to congratulate the newly-elected AU chief.</p>
<p>"Kenya congratulates him on a race well won. We pledge to work with him to defend the pan-African agenda of integration for Africa, as well as democracy, sovereignty and prosperity for all of its people," a statement by Kenya's State House spokesperson Manoah Esipisu said.</p>
<p>Faki is not new to the workings of the AU, having previously served as the body's chair of the Economic, Social and Cultural Council.</p>
<p>Heads of state from the 54-member countries cast their vote in a private ballot.</p>
<p>A candidate needs to secure at least a two-thirds majority, 36 votes, to be declared winner.</p>
<p>The AU was supposed to pick a new leader in July last year but the election was postponed following three rounds of voting after candidates failed to garner the required number of votes.</p>
<p>More than 50 percent of the member states abstained from the second round of voting last year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the AU is expected to vote on Tuesday whether Morocco, the only country in Africa that is not part of the organisation, will be re-admitted into the body.</p>
<p>Rabat withdrew from the union in 1984 to protest against the admission of disputed Western Sahara territories.<br><br><em><strong>Follow Hamza Mohamed on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Hamza_Africa" target="_blank">@Hamza_Africa</a></strong></em></p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera News</span></p>
