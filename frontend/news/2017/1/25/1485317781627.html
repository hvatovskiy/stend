<p>America's longest war isn't something that he has said much about, and - as with so many issues - what he has said is contradictory.</p><p>In the past, he has described America's involvement in Afghanistan as a "disaster", and has talked about pulling out US troops.  </p><p>But when he spoke to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on 2 December, he reportedly told him that America would not waver in its commitment to Afghanistan.</p><p>Then, however, he failed to invite Mr Ghani to his inauguration, deepening worries in Afghanistan that it simply was not a priority for the new president.</p><p>The Taliban pitched in earlier this week, calling on President Trump to withdraw American forces from what they described as the "quagmire" of Afghanistan. </p><p>"Nothing has been achieved," said the insurgent group, "except the staining of innocent Afghans in their blood, and the destruction of villages and gardens."</p><p>The official American assessment of progress is not much more upbeat.  </p><p>Mr Trump's challenge <a href="https://www.sigar.mil/interactive-reports/high-risk-list/index.html" class="story-body__link-external">was summarised with shocking clarity earlier this month by the US watchdog overseeing the reconstruction process in Afghanistan</a>, the special inspector general for Afghanistan, John F Sopko.</p><p>Mr Sopko says the US has spent more in real terms in Afghanistan than America spent on the reconstruction of Europe after World War Two, yet only 63% of the country is currently controlled by the Afghan government, opium production is at record highs and corruption is still rife. </p><p>"After 15 years," he says, "Afghanistan still cannot support itself financially or functionally. </p><p>"Long-term financial assistance is required if the country is to survive."</p><p>Just how vulnerable parts of the country are became very apparent when an Afghan colleague was given rare access to the battle against the Taliban in Helmand a few weeks ago.</p><p>Aziz Ahmad Shafee flew into the provincial capital, Lashkargah, with soldiers from the Afghan National Army's 215th Corps. </p><p>A convoy of Humvees drove the troops a few kilometres to the outskirts of the city: that is where the front line is now.</p><p>The Taliban now control more than 80% of Helmand. </p><p>A province, let us not forget, where most of the 456 British military personnel killed in the Afghan conflict lost their lives. </p><p>And - despite a complete restructuring of the command of the 215th Corps overseen by American forces - it seems it still is not combat effective.  </p><p>Afghan troops complain they lack even the most basic supplies. </p><p>"For a month we've been saying we are running out of ammunition but we don't get any new supplies," Sgt class 1 Hyatullah told the BBC. </p><p>"Our enemy is firing at us, but we don't have enough bullets to take them on."</p><p>His commander urged America's new president not to falter in his commitment to the Afghan government.  </p><p>"As a soldier of Afghanistan, I ask his excellency Donald Trump to continue the fight here", said Brig Gen Mohammad Wali Ahmadzai, the commander of the 215th Corps in Helmand.  </p><p>"If he can give us more support, we can wipe the terrorists out."  </p><p>Most of the foreign troops in Afghanistan <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29776544" class="story-body__link">were withdrawn at the end of 2014</a>, but when I visited the headquarters of Resolute Support, the Nato mission in Afghanistan, it was busy, with helicopters flying in and out every few minutes.  </p><p>There are still 13,000 Nato military personnel in Afghanistan, mostly American.</p><p>Brig Gen Charlie Cleveland, the spokesman for the Resolute Support mission, believes America still has a clear strategic interest in Afghanistan. </p><p>He says the US troops now have two tasks: </p><p>Resolute Support's work with the Afghan army has, says the brigadier general, been instrumental in ensuring it has managed to hold the ground it does. </p><p>"In the winter of 2015-16, the government of Afghanistan changed their strategy," Brig Gen Cleveland tells me. </p><p>"They realised they couldn't defend everywhere, and so what they really started focusing their efforts on was the major population centres. </p><p>"As we look at the security situation right now, the government controls - secures - really about two-thirds of the population. </p><p>"About 10% of the population is controlled by the Taliban, and the remaining difference is really what's contested."</p><p>He says while this situation is not ideal, the Afghan army has managed to reverse what was a deteriorating situation in 2015 and establish an "equilibrium" in favour of the government.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is much work to be done. </p><p>Some 5,000 Afghan military personnel were killed last year, losses both the Afghan government and Resolute Support agree are unsustainable in the long term.</p><p>And, amid the uncertainty about American policy, other powers have been flexing their muscles in Afghanistan. </p><p>Last month, Russia hosted a meeting in Moscow about the country's future, with senior officials from China and Pakistan, and it makes no secret of the fact it has been talking to the Taliban.</p><p>So the big question is what will President Trump do?</p><p>Two of his key cabinet picks may provide a clue.  </p><p>President Trump's Defence Secretary, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38178625" class="story-body__link">Gen James Mattis, is a former commander of forces here</a>. </p><p>He has spoken in the past about the need to urge Pakistan to take further action against the Taliban and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33740337)." class="story-body__link">the Sunni Islamist militant Haqqani network</a>.</p><p>The new president's national security adviser, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38025057" class="story-body__link">Lt Gen Michael Flynn</a>, has also talked about the need for Pakistan to take tougher action against Taliban fighters who shelter there.</p><p>And President Trump has been very consistent about his desire to take a tougher line against the so-called Islamic State group. </p><p>Pulling out of Afghanistan would make that more difficult, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35595446" class="story-body__link">given the toe-hold it has established in eastern Afghanistan</a> over the past couple of years.  </p><p>So it seems unlikely that - in his effort to extricate America from foreign entanglements - President Trump will simply declare that it has no strategic interest in Afghanistan and withdraw his troops.   </p>
