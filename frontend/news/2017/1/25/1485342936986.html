"Nevertheless, discriminatory dress codes remain commonplace in some sectors of the economy.</p><p>"We call on the government to review this area of the law and to ask parliament to change it, if necessary, to make it more effective."</p><p>The committees heard expert evidence that requirements to wear high heeled shoes were damaging to women's health.</p><p>The College of Podiatry pointed out that high heels cause pain for a fifth of women within just 10 minutes. On average it said ill-fitting high heels are painful after 1 hour, 6 minutes and 48 seconds.</p><p>Such shoes can also be disabling if worn for a long time, the College warned.</p><p>Women said high heels impaired their performance and made them feel humiliated or sexualised. Some said they struggled to wear heels because of medical conditions including:</p><p>Portico, Ms Thorp's then employer, said: "We fully support the recommendations within the report and welcome the debate in Parliament in March." </p><p>"When this issue was raised last year we immediately updated our uniform guidance." </p><p>A government spokesperson said: "No employer should discriminate against workers on grounds of gender - it is unacceptable and is against the law. Dress codes must be reasonable and include equivalent requirements for both men and women. </p>
