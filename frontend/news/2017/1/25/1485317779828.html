<p>Kisenosato, 30, was promoted to the top-most yokozuna rank after his win in the first tournament of the year.  </p><p>He is the first Japanese-born wrestler to make it since Wakanohana in 1998. Five wrestlers from American Samoa and Mongolia have made it in the interim.</p><p>Foreign wrestlers have come to dominate sumo, amid a lack of local recruits. </p><p>Kisenosato, who comes from Ibaraki to the north of Tokyo, has been an ozeki - the second-highest rank - since 2012. </p><p>After being runner-up on multiple occasions, he finally clinched his first tournament victory - and thereby his promotion to yokozuna - in the first competition of 2017. </p><p>"I think it was the support I received that enabled me to come this far," he said in a tearful post-win interview on Sunday. "I desperately hung on at the end."</p><p>Many Japanese fans will be pleased to see a local wrestler back at the top of a sport regarded as a cultural icon. </p><p>As yokuzuna, Kisenosato, whose real name is whose real name is Yutaka Hagiwara, joins three other wrestlers in sumo's ultimate rank - Hakuho, Harumafuji and Kakuryu. </p><p>The trio all come from Mongolia, following a path forged by sumo bad-boy Asashoryu, who was Mongolia's first yokozuna in 2003. </p><p>The last Japanese-born wrestlers to reach the top were brothers Takanohana and Wakanohana, who made it to yokozuna in 1994 and 1998 respectively. </p><p>In recent years, sumo has been hit by falling numbers of Japanese recruits, partly because it is seen as a tough, highly regimented life. </p><p>Young sumo wrestlers train in tightly-knit "stables" where they eat, sleep and practise together and are sometimes subjected to harsh treatment in the belief that it will toughen them up. </p><p>In 2009, a leading coach was jailed for six years for ordering wrestlers to beat a young trainee who later died, in a case that shocked the nation. </p><p>Those at the top of Japan's national sport are also expected to be role models, showing honour and humility - and can be criticised if they get it wrong. </p><p>Sumo must also compete with the rising popularity of football and baseball, which have vibrant leagues that draw crowds of young Japanese fans.</p><p>But the sport is attractive to wrestlers from other nations, who can earn a good living. Wrestlers have come from Estonia, Bulgaria, Georgia, China, Hawaii and Egypt, as well as Mongolia and American Samoa. </p><p>As a child, Kisenosato was a pitcher in his school's baseball club before he chose to train as a wrestler at a stable in Tokyo. </p><p>He made his debut in 2002 and, reported Japan's Mainichi newspaper, the 73 tournaments he took to become a yokozuna are the most by any wrestler since 1926. </p><p>Speaking to reporters after the tournament victory on Monday that sealed his elevation, Kisenosato said he was pleased to be holding the Emperor's Cup trophy at last. </p>
