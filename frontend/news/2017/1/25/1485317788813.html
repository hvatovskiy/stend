<p>But what's extraordinary is that his house, where he lives with his wife and two children in Mwea, central Kenya, has no access to mains electricity. </p><p>Instead, the power for Mr Gikonyo's new TV service comes directly from the sun. He is one of the early adopters of AzuriTV - a new solar-powered satellite TV service that gives his family access to 50 channels.</p><p>He says the system is already making his life easier, and has opened new doors for his farming business.</p><p>"I had been using other solar panels and normal batteries, which gave me a hell of a time in charging them, and with acid spills," he says.</p><p>"The AzuriTV has for sure done me good - I can now watch my favourite stations. In particular, I watch Shamba Shape Up, which gives a lot of insights into the best farming practices.</p><p>"I am connected to the whole world." </p><p>Mr Gikonyo runs a small farm, or shamba, producing mostly vegetables and poultry, and he was one of the estimated 69% of Kenya's adult population that does not have daily access to television.</p><p>UK-based solar company Azuri Technologies and Kenyan satellite TV provider Zuku launched the service in Kenya in December. </p><p>A solar panel is fixed to the roof of a customer's home, and connects to a battery which powers a range of appliances, including lamps, a mobile phone charger, and a 24-inch (61cm) TV which accesses Zuku's Smart satellite TV service.</p><p>Users pay an upfront fee of 4,999 Kenyan shillings (£39) for the system, and thereafter pay 149 shillings(£1.15) per day. By the end of two years on this payment schedule, customers own the kit outright.</p><p>While solar power products have been available in Kenya for several years, and some free-to-air terrestrial TV stations have been accessible in rural areas, this is the first time off-grid households have had access to a full range of satellite pay-TV channels.</p><p>All powered by the sun.</p><p>Missionary teacher Zacharia Maundu, who lives with his wife and two children in Kenya's Embu county, says: "My experience with AzuriTV is fantastic. Through it I am no longer cut off from information and entertainment. </p><p>"Watching the news has made us updated with the world's happenings."</p><p>AzuriTV provides lighting in their home, including a security night light, as well as access to world news and entertainment.</p><p>"Azuri aims to go beyond lighting and to provide each customer with TVs, internet access, entertainment and a range of services," says Azuri Technologies boss Simon Bransfield-Garth.</p><p>But he's not the only one to recognise this demand.</p><p>M-Kopa Solar has been providing pay-as-you-go solar power in East Africa for the past five years. About 500,000 households across the region use the company's products, and 10 months ago, the firm added 30 free-to-air TV channels to its offering.</p><p>"It was very demand driven," says Jesse Moore, M-Kopa Solar's chief executive. "TV has always been something people aspire to having in their homes."</p><p>He envisages solar powering an increasing number of home appliances, with refrigeration and air conditioning supplementing lighting, TV and internet.</p><p>And last year, tech company Cello Electronics developed a solar-powered 22-inch (56cm) TV designed to service the 1.2 billion people in the world without access to a reliable electricity supply.</p><p>Its smart antenna picks up high definition broadcasts and also has a built-in satellite tuner, while the solar panel and battery can provide up to 10 hours of operation on a single charge, the company says.</p><p>Realising that the $300 cost might be prohibitive for many poorer regions, Cello has introduced its own pay-as-you-watch scheme whereby householders only pay for the amount of TV they watch. </p><p>They can buy unlock codes through the remote control handset. </p><p>Danson Njue, research analyst at Ovum, says that while solar-powered satellite TV is a substantial addition to the services previously available to rural and off-grid consumers, its popularity will attract more competitors in to the market.</p><p>"The service may face some challenges, such as price competition from other service providers, as well as increased rural electrification under the government-led last mile connectivity project," says Mr Njue.</p><p>"In my opinion, increased electrification may see some households switch to other services that use normal grid power as opposed to solar."</p><p>But connecting people to mains electricity is expensive.</p><p>The Africa Progress Panel, chaired by former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, estimates that investment in electricity infrastructure would need to rise to $55bn (£44bn) a year across the continent, compared to the $8bn a year currently being spent.</p><p>M-Kopa Solar's Mr Moore concedes that traditional infrastructure roll-out could pose a threat to solar power, but he believes it is the add-on services, like TV, that that will encourage rural populations to "leapfrog" traditional infrastructure and embrace sustainable power.</p><p>"If all we could achieve was lighting, any rational customer would hope the grid will come to them," says Mr Moore. </p><p>"But as we add more services, we hope customers will ask 'why would I connect to the grid?' Adding grid power is more expensive, less reliable, and doesn't offer relevant payment models.</p><p>"We think ultimately rural Africa will leapfrog the grid, and have access to all sorts of services."</p><p>Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_wall" class="story-body__link-external">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MatthewWallBBC/" class="story-body__link-external">Facebook</a></p>
