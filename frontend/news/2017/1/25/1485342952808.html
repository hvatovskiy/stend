<p>The assault on Wednesday morning began when attackers rammed an explosives-packed car into the gate of Dayah Hotel, which is near Somalia's parliament in central Mogadishu, and then stormed inside exchanging gunfire with security guards.</p>
<p>A second massive car bomb blast went off after ambulances and journalists had arrived at the scene, leaving at least four reporters wounded, according to AFP news agency.</p>

<p>Witnesses said the powerful explosions caused extensive damage in the area near the hotel, shattering dozens of windows and damaging parked cars. </p>
<p>"All the neighbouring houses have been destroyed," Yusuf Hassan, editor of Somali newspaper Haqiqa Times, told Al Jazeera from the scene.</p>
<p>"I see people crying because they have lost their relatives," he added.</p>
<p>"It is really a big tragedy."</p>

<p>Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack, according to a report by Andalus radio, which is linked to the armed group.</p>
<p>"Well-armed mujahideen [fighters] attacked the hotel and now they are fighting inside the hotel," the report said.</p>
<p><span> Dozens of people, including members of Somalia's parliament, were thought to have been in the hotel at the time of the attack, </span><span>Captain Mohamed Hussein told The Associated Press news agency. </span></p>
<p>The hotel is popular with politicians, government officials and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Al-Shabab has carried out a series of deadly attacks in Somalia to try to topple the country's western-backed government.</p>
<p>In June, the group claimed responsibility for an <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/blasts-gunfire-hit-hotel-somalia-mogadishu-160625135956380.html">attack</a> on the Nasa Hablod hotel, which killed at least 15 people.</p>
