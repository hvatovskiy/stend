<p>He has signed several executive orders in his first few days into the job. Many of them undoing laws and deals that were put in place by former President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>On Monday, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is a trade deal the Obama administration had worked on for several years.</p>
<p>It calls for lower taxes on trade between member countries.</p>
<p>Obama had said this would give the US an economic advantage over China, which was not part of the agreement.</p>
<p>But Trump insists withdrawal from the deal is a great thing for American workers.</p>
<p>Does he risk isolating his country? And who stands to gain from his decision?</p>
