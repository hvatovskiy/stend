<p>A number of Conservatives have joined Labour in asking for a White Paper on negotiating objectives, arguing it will allow for a fuller debate.  </p><p>It comes after the Supreme Court ruled MPs must vote on whether the government can start Brexit.</p><p>A parliamentary bill paving the way for talks with the EU could be introduced as early as Thursday.</p><p>More than half a dozen Conservative MPs including some ex-ministers are calling for a White Paper - a government policy document which sets out proposals for future acts of Parliament - on Brexit to be published in the coming days. </p><p>The BBC understands they discussed this with Conservative Party whips on Tuesday.</p><p>Downing Street, while not explicitly ruling out a White Paper, stressed that Prime Minister Theresa May had already set out her plan for Brexit. In a speech last week, she announced the UK would be leaving the European single market and customs union, but would push for the "freest possible trade" with EU countries. </p><p>But Labour is warning it is prepared to engage in "hand-to-hand combat" in Parliament to ensure the process of leaving the EU is fully scrutinised.</p><p>The party says it will not vote against a parliamentary bill invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - getting talks with the EU under way - but will try to amend it.</p><p>The Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that the government could only invoke Article 50 with a vote in Parliament - rejecting ministers' argument that this was not necessary.</p><p>BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she expected a short bill to be published on Thursday, with a view to it being debated for the first time next week.</p><p>Mrs May wants to invoke Article 50 by the end of March.</p><p>Almost all Conservative MPs are expected to back the government and the bill is likely to pass. But a few Tory MPs - including former ministers Anna Soubry, Alistair Burt and Nicky Morgan - are pressing for an explicit commitment for a White Paper.</p><p>For Labour, shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government was creating a "drip-feed" of information, adding: "Parliamentarians would like to see a central role for Parliament in shaping this country."</p><p>But former Conservative leader Lord Howard told Today: "The government has been instructed by the British people to negotiate our exit from the European Union." It was "ridiculous" to argue that Parliament should guide negotiations, he added.</p><p>The Scottish National Party says it has 50 amendments "ready to go" and expects to be properly consulted over issues such as trade and customs arrangement on an "equal basis".</p><p>The Liberal Democrats, who have only nine MPs but more than 100 peers, say they will vote against triggering Article 50 unless there is a guarantee of the public having a vote on the final deal reached between the UK government and the EU.</p><p>Leader Tim Farron said that if the referendum he was proposing rejected whatever deal the UK had reached with the EU, the country would stay in the European Union.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Scottish government will set out its official response to the Supreme Court's ruling on Wednesday.</p><p>The 11 justices ruled that the UK government was not legally bound to take the views of the Scottish Parliament and other devolved administrations into account when triggering Article 50.</p>
