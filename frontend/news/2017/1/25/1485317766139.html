<p>The American, 35, won 6-2 6-3 and will next play Croatia's unseeded <b>Mirjana Lucic-Baroni,</b> who beat fifth seed Czech Karolina Plisokva 6-4 3-6 6-4.</p><p>Konta, seeded ninth, went into the quarter-final on a nine-match and 18-set winning streak but came up short in her first meeting with Williams.</p><p>Williams is now two wins from claiming an Open-era record 23rd major title. </p><p>"Johanna Konta has been playing so well," said the second seed.</p><p>"I was in the locker room watching her clean up her matches, she is a future champion here for sure, so I am pleased to get through this. </p><p>"I got a little frustrated with my serve, but I told myself 'don't get Babyrena' and focused on enjoying myself out here. Today I felt I can do this, it is such a great opportunity for me."</p><p>In a match of big hitting and small margins, it was Williams who established an early control that she would not relinquish.</p><p>The American's usually dominant first serve faltered as she made just 45%, but she returned brilliantly to break the Konta serve - the best on tour this season going into the match - four times.</p><p>Konta had the first chance but went long with a backhand on break point at 1-1, and then found her second serve under greater pressure than at any stage of the tournament so far.</p><p>Williams looked razor sharp on return, with two thumping forehand winners setting the American on the way to a 3-1 lead.</p><p>More heavy blows brought a second break, and with it the set, in game eight to end a run of 18 straight sets for Konta stretching back to her warm-up win in Sydney.</p><p>Konta showed why she had been seen as a real threat by recovering from 0-40 early in the second set and then breaking to lead 3-1, but a loose game handed the advantage back and Williams raced through five straight games to victory.</p><p>World number 79 Lucic-Baroni upset Plisokva to reach the semi-finals in Melbourne - 18 years after she reached the same stage at Wimbledon.</p><p>The 34-year-old hardly played in the early years of the century <a href="/sport/tennis/28992766">because of a series of personal issues.</a></p><p>"I can't believe this, this is crazy," said Lucic-Baroni.</p><p>"The only thing I can say is god is good. I can't believe I'm in the semi-finals again. I feel a little bit in shock right now.</p><p>"I know this means a lot to every player but to me this is overwhelming, this has truly made my life and everything bad that has happened OK."</p><p>Lucic-Baroni was a tennis prodigy, winning junior titles at the Australian and US Opens, and winning the Australian Open doubles with Martina Hingis in 1998.</p><p>She went on to reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon the following year, losing to Steffi Graf.</p><p>Lucic-Baroni and Williams will meet for the first time since Wimbledon 1998 in Thursday's semi-final, which begins at 03:00 GMT.</p><p>"It is really happening for the mid-thirties," said Williams.</p><p>"Mirjana - it is so good to see her back out and inspiring to see her in the semi-finals. Whatever happens there will be someone in the final in their mid-thirties."</p>
