<p>The hangings on Wednesday were the first executions in the oil-rich Gulf state since mid-2013.</p>
<p>Those executed included two Kuwaitis, two Egyptians, a Bangladeshi, a Filipina and an Ethiopian. They were convicted of offences ranging from murder, attempted murder, kidnapping and rape.</p>

<p><span> The Kuwaiti government identified the royal as Sheikh Faisal Abdullah Al Jaber Al Sabah and said he was convicted of premeditated murder and illegal possession of a firearm. </span></p>
<p>Nusra al-Enezi, the other Kuwaiti, was convicted of setting fire to a tent in 2009 during a wedding party for her husband, killing around 57 people, including women and children.</p>
<p>It was an apparent act of revenge against her husband for taking a second wife.</p>
<p>The Filipina and Ethiopian women were domestic helpers convicted of murdering members of their employers' families in two unrelated crimes.</p>
<p>The two Egyptians were convicted of premeditated murders, while the Bangladeshi was convicted of abduction and rape.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, authorities had earlier identified the Filipina hanged as Jakatia Pawa, who was convicted of killing her employer's 22-year old daughter in 2007.</p>

<p>In an interview with ABS-CBN television, Charles Jose, a spokesman for the department of foreign affairs, said the Philippine government pursued diplomatic, political and religious channels to free Pawa.</p>
<p>Pawa's brother, Gary Pawa, told the Associated Press news agency that his sister had called early on Wednesday morning, crying as she informed him of her scheduled execution.</p>
<p>She asked him to take care of her two children.</p>
<p>In a separate interview with the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Pawa said the execution came as a shock as they were hoping that his sister would be home soon.</p>
<p>He said his sister was innocent.  </p>
<p>The last known executions to be carried out in Kuwait were in 2013, when a Pakistani, a Saudi and a "Bidoon", or man without citizenship in the emirate, were hung.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
