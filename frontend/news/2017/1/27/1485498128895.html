<p><span>Their decision came after Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra, attacked their positions in Idlib and Aleppo provinces. The six factions include Alwiyat Suqour al-Sham, Kataib Thawar al-Sham, Jaish al-Mujahideen and Tajamo Fastaqim Kama Umirat, along with </span><span>Jaish al-Islam's Idlib branch and al-Jabha al-Shamiya's west Aleppo branch.</span></p>
<p>Ahrar al-Sham issued a statement on Thursday welcoming the factions and warning that any attack on them would be considered "a declaration of war". </p>
<p>Tensions between Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and armed opposition groups, including the Free Syrian Army (FSA), escalated on Tuesday evening after Jabhat Fateh al-Sham attacked factional headquarters across the two provinces.</p>

<p>A commander of one FSA faction, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera that Jabhat Fateh al-Sham continued to attack the six armed groups, even after the announcement. According to him, s<span>poradic clashes occurred between Ahrar al-Sham and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham throughout the day.</span></p>
<p>He also said that <span>Jabhat Fateh al-Sham</span> had attacked FSA positions in Idlib province and captured a number of its fighters, but cited no casualties in the clashes.</p>
<p>He denied media reports that Jabhat Fateh al-Sham had wiped out a number of FSA factions, but confirmed that the group had captured the headquarters of Jaish al-Mujahideen, Jaish al-Islam and al-Jabha al-Shamiya. </p>
<p><span>The commander told Al Jazeera that the situation remained tense in Idlib province and that Ahrar al-Sham and a number of senior religious figures were involved in negotiations to restore calm. </span></p>

<p><span>In an earlier statement, Ahrar al-Sham had said that it was sending its forces to prevent </span><span>Jabhat Fateh al-Sham</span><span> attacking or committing injustices against other factions. </span></p>
<p><span>Ahrar al-Sham was <a href="http://function.mil.ru/news_page/country/more.htm?id=12107227" target="_blank">among</a> the seven armed groups that Russia declared as "moderate opposition", which were part of the ceasefire announced on December 30, 2016. However, Ahrar al-Sham opted not to participate in the recent Astana talks, while the FSA, Jaish al-Islam and other armed opposition groups sent a delegation. </span></p>
<p><span>"Nusra is trying to present it as though the FSA factions want to surrender, to have the Assad regime stay in power and reach a settlement with Russia. By attacking them, it supposedly is preventing such a settlement from taking place," </span><span lang="TR">Hamza al-Mustafa</span><span>, a researcher at the Arab Centre for Research and Policy Studies in Doha, told Al Jazeera.</span></p>
<p><span>Mustafa said that </span><span>Jabhat Fateh al-Sham's</span><span> attacks on the FSA and other armed opposition groups were prompted by the group's desire to prevent a military union between the FSA, Ahrar al-Sham and various other rebel factions. T</span><span>he current standoff has its roots in a long-term rivalry between the two groups, and in the refusal of Ahrar al-Sham to join Jabhat Fateh al-Sham in establishing an Islamic emirate, Mustafa said.</span></p>

<p><span>The FSA commander interviewed by Al Jazeera said that his faction was attacked previously by </span><span>Jabhat Fateh al-Sham </span><span>in 2015, before the group changed its name and severed ties with al-Qaeda. He said that he believes the group is attacking the FSA in an effort to establish an Islamic emirate.</span></p>
<p><span>Both </span><span>Jabhat Fateh al-Sham</span><span> and Ahrar al-Sham have suffered from internal divisions as a result of the current standoff, Mustafa noted.</span></p>
<p><span>Jabhat Fateh al-Sham</span><span> leader Abu Mariya al-Qahtani's condemnation of the clashes - along with the refusal of some of his fighters to carry out orders to attack the FSA, and the defection of others to Ahrar al-Sham - has pressured </span><span>Jabhat Fateh al-Sham </span><span>to temporarily halt its attacks, he added.</span></p>
