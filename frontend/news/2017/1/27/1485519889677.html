<p>Politician Madeleine Albright and Mayim Bialik said they "stand ready" to register, in defiance of the new President.</p><p>"I was raised Catholic, became Episcopalian &amp; found out later my family was Jewish," Ms Albright - the first woman to be named Secretary of State - tweeted on Wednesday.</p><p>"I stand ready to register as Muslim in #solidarity." The tweet gained tens of thousands of likes.</p><p>Her comments come as rumours continue to circulate about an executive order which would announce extreme vetting, a refugee ban and a ban on arrivals from seven countries, said to include Syria, Yemen and Iraq.</p><p>But there has been no mention of a register of American Muslims in recent months - something Mr Trump said he would "certainly implement" in an interview in 2015, but later distanced himself from.</p><p>A number of people vowed <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38026825" class="story-body__link">to stand in solidarity with America's Muslim population</a> after Mr Trump's election in November, but Ms Albright's tweet appears to have inspired others to speak out - including Ms Bialik, who stars as Amy Farrah Fowler in the hit series The Big Bang Theory, one of America's most popular sitcoms.</p><p>"I'm Jewish. I stand ready to register as a Muslim in #solidarity if it comes to that," she wrote.</p><p>Later, the outspoken Trump critic added: "If we're registering people who you think are a threat, register white males too, since most serial killers &amp; mass shooters are white males."</p><p>It has been reported that the President will be announcing his new executive order on Thursday.</p><p>"Look, the president has talked extensively about extreme vetting," White House spokesman Sean Spicer said, promising "more action this week".</p><p>Many, including Ms Albright, a Czech immigrant, are highly critical of the move - which is rumoured to mean the US would accept no Syrian refugees.</p><p>"There is no fine print on the Statue of Liberty," she tweeted. "America must remain open to people of all faiths &amp; backgrounds. #RefugeesWelcome."</p>
