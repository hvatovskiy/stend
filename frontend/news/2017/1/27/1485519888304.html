<p>Borrowing the names of organisations like Nasa and the Environmental Protection Agency they are directly attacking the president.</p><p>Mr Trump has called climate change a hoax.</p><p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/RogueNASA" class="story-body__link-external">@RogueNASA</a> account says it is the "unofficial 'Resistance' team of NASA".</p><p>"Not an official NASA account. Not managed by gov't employees. Come for the facts, stay for the snark," the account declares.</p><p>BBC News contacted the rogue Environmental Protection Agency account called @ActualEPAFacts. </p><p>They told us they acted to make sure "factual information about climate change and other scientific research continues to be shared during the Trump administration".</p><p>They claimed to be three EPA employees and said they acted after a gagging order stopped them from doing interviews relating to their research.  </p><p>Media <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-epa-idUSKBN15822X" class="story-body__link-external">reports have suggested</a> that the Trump administration sought to limit how certain government agencies - including the EPA - communicate with the public. The official EPA Twitter account has not posted since 19 January, a day before Mr Trump's inauguration.</p><p>ActualEPAFacts told us they were surprised by how many people are now following their account - more than 90,000 currently - but also felt exposed by what they were doing.</p><p>The other rogue accounts also have large numbers of followers. More than 370,000 are following @RogueNasa after a handful of tweets in a few days.</p><p>The rogue National Park Service account <a href="https://twitter.com/AltNatParkSer" class="story-body__link-external">@AltNatParkSer</a> has attracted even more people, with more than a million followers after less than 300 tweets. </p><p>There are also rogue accounts for the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>They use similar phrases such as "resistance" to describe themselves and post a mixture of scientific information and attacks on Mr Trump.</p><p>Some of those running the other alternative accounts also claimed to be disgruntled government agency workers, at least going by their tweets.</p><p>The @AltNatParkSer account <a href="https://twitter.com/AltNatParkSer/status/824081620240056321" class="story-body__link-external">tweeted</a> on Tuesday that they were "being run by several active NPS rangers and friends".</p><p>However, on Thursday they <a href="https://twitter.com/AltNatParkSer/status/824582012266745861" class="story-body__link-external">said they were handing over to a different group of people</a> - activists and journalists who were former scientists.</p><p>On Tuesday the official account of Badlands National Park in South Dakota started tweeting about global warming, but those posts were later deleted.</p><p>The people behind the @AltNatParkSer told us this inspired them to set up their Twitter account.</p><p>The other alternative accounts also appear to have been created after the Badlands tweets were deleted, while some <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38745829" class="story-body__link">official US national park accounts</a> also tweeted about climate change on Wednesday.   </p>
