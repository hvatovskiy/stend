<p>They said the "disheartening" results suggested the problem could snowball to affect future careers.</p><p>The study on 400 children, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aah6524" class="story-body__link-external">in the journal Science,</a> initially found both five-year-old boys and girls thought their own gender was "brilliant".</p><p>But then only one year later, gender differences had emerged.  </p><p>The team from Princeton University, New York University and the University of Illinois said it appeared stereotypes were starting to show.</p><p>Suspected influences include exposure to media, teachers, parents and other children. </p><p>The study put sets of five, six and seven-year-olds through different experiments. </p><p>In one, the children were read a story about someone who is "really, really smart" but it is not clear who the story is about.</p><p>They then had to guess the protagonist from four pictures - two of men and two of women.</p><p>At age five, boys pick men and girls pick women around 75% of the time. But fast-forward a year to age six and boys are still picking men while girls are now slightly more likely to pick men too. </p><p>In another scenario, groups of children played a new board game.</p><p>But for some it was branded as "for children who are really, really smart" and for others it was described as "for children who try really, really hard".</p><p>Six and seven-year old girls were as likely as boys to enjoy the game for those who try, but much less likely to say they enjoy the game for smart children.</p><p>Prof Andrei Cimpian, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: "The message that comes out of these data is that young kids are exposed to the cultural notion that genius is more likely a male than a female quality.</p><p>"It's disheartening to see these effects emerge so early. When you see them, you realise how much of an uphill battle it's going to be."</p><p>His research has previously looked at academic careers associated with needing innate brilliance in order to succeed. </p><p>It argued that the higher people rated the need for genius - such as in physics or philosophy - the <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6219/262" class="story-body__link-external">lower the number of women</a> involved. </p><p>Prof Cimpian added: "Early on, society's stereotypes can create differences in trajectory.</p><p>"At five, six or seven you're not thinking about a career, but soon you're making decisions about what courses to take and what extracurriculars to take part in. </p><p>"Even if the difference starts small it can snowball into something a lot bigger."</p><p>Fellow researcher Dr Lin Bian advised parents and teachers to emphasise the importance of hard work. </p><p>She told the BBC: "[Studies suggest] that everyone does better when hard work is believed as the key to success. </p><p>"In our studies, girls might be particularly impacted by the messages focusing on 'hard work' - they became equally interested in playing the game as boys. </p><p>"Thus conveying the importance of hard work to success could protect and even promote young girls' interests." </p><p>The UK's Fawcett Society campaigns on the gender pay gap and <a href="http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/policy-research/challenging-gender-stereotypes-in-early-years/" class="story-body__link-external">argues early differences</a> - blue and superheroes versus pink and princesses - is part of the problem.</p><p>Sam Smethers, the organisation's chief executive, said: "This is a massive issue and it is holding us all, but particularly girls, back.</p><p>"<a href="http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sounds-Familiar-January-2017.pdf" class="story-body__link-external">Our research</a> found that young women experienced gender stereotypes at school and from an early age."</p>
