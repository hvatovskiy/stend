<p>Avalanches struck an army post and a patrol along the Line of Control (LoC) <span>that divides the disputed territory with Pakistan</span>.</p>
<p>All eleven members of the patrol, that was approaching the border post along the LoC, were killed.</p>
<p>"Four more bodies were recovered today [Friday]. No one else is missing," army spokesman Colonel Rajesh Kalia told AFP news agency.</p>
<p>Another separate torrent of snow in the same remote Gurez area buried three other troops at an army post.</p>
<p>The bodies of 10 soldiers were pulled from the snow on Thursday.</p>
<p>Four members of a single family also died on Wednesday in the same area when the house they were sleeping in was hit by an avalanche. A lone survivor was rescued.</p>

<p>Dozens of Indian and Pakistani soldiers are killed almost every winter by avalanches along the LoC.</p>
<p>In 2012, a massive avalanche in the Pakistan-controlled side of Kashmir killed 140 people, including 129 soldiers.</p>
<p>Kashmir is divided between the nuclear-armed neighbours and is a long-running source of tension between them.</p>
<p>Indian-administered Kashmir has been witnessing one of the most severe winters in recent decades, with heavy snow across the territory and temperatures dropping to minus 7C.</p>
<p>The timesofindia.com website reported that a high-danger avalanche warning had been issued in the area after intermittent snowfall in the last three days.</p>
<p>Meteorologists have forecast more heavy snow across the territory over the next two more days.</p>
<p>Last week police evacuated 80 villagers from Waltengoo Nar - where dozens were killed after a series of avalanches hit the area in 2005 - in the south of Kashmir.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
