<p>However, the research remains at a very early stage and proved more difficult than expected, the researchers reported in the peer-reviewed journal Cell on Thursday.</p>
<p>"This is an important first step," said lead investigator Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor in the Salk Institute of Biological Studies' Gene Expression Laboratory.</p>
<p>"The ultimate goal is to grow functional and transplantable tissue or organs, but we are far away from that."</p>
<p>Scientists implanted adult human stem cells - known as intermediate induced pluripotent stem cells - into pig embryos and allowed them to grow for four weeks.</p>

<p>They terminated the embryos before any human-animal mixture, known as a chimera after the cross-species figures of Greek mythology, could be born.</p>
<p>They found that the human cells began to form into muscle tissue in the pig embryos.</p>
<p>The effort involved some 1,500 pig embryos and took four years, far longer than initially estimated, due to the complicated nature of the experiments.</p>
<p>The notion of creating human-animal mixtures has stoked controversy and raised ethical questions, particularly since the experiments could theoretically lead to the creation of animals with human qualities, and possibly intelligence.</p>
<p>But Salk Institute staff scientist Jun Wu said the level of human contribution to the pig embryos was "low", and did not include precursors to brain cells.</p>
<p>Previous research has produced combinations of rats and mice, which are far more closely related.</p>

<p>Bruce Whitelaw, professor of animal biotechnology at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study, described it as "exciting" because it "paves the way for significant advances".</p>
<p>According to Darren Griffin, professor of genetics at the University of Kent, the "work will also help us better understand evolution, development and disease" and may eventually lead to a remedy for organ shortages.</p>
<p>"In this study, the authors followed existing legal and ethical guidelines, allowing the embryos to develop to the maximum time allowed," he told the AFP news agency.</p>
<p>"It is important that any further research is conducted with full transparency so as to allow public scrutiny and debate," Griffin said.</p>
