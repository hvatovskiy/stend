<p>"Trump's visa ban for Iranians is racist. Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won't attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest," tweeted Taraneh Alidoosti, the film's 33-year-old lead actress.</p>
<p>Trump is reportedly poised to stop visas for travellers from seven Muslim countries, including Iran, for 30 days.</p>
<p>He told ABC News on Wednesday that his plan was not a "Muslim ban", but targeted countries that "have tremendous terror".</p>
<p>"The Salesman", directed by acclaimed Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi is nominated for best foreign language film at the Academy Awards, which take place next month.</p>
<p>Farhadi won an Oscar in 2012 for his film "A Separation".</p>
<p>Visa applications from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen are all expected to be stopped for a month under a draft executive order published in the Washington Post and New York Times.</p>
<p>The draft order also seeks to suspend the US refugee programme for four months as officials draw up a list of low risk countries.</p>
<p>The Oscars are due to take place on February 26.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">AFP news agency</span></p>
