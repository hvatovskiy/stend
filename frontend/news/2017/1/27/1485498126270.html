    <div id="vdoContainer" class="video-container"></div><div id="article-body" class="article-body"><p>Cameroon's main language is French, but about one-fifth of the country's 22 million people are English speakers.</p>
<p>They are concentrated in the country's northwest and southwest regions, which were colonised by Britain.</p>
<p>English speakers have long complained of discrimination.</p>
<p>They say that official documents are always in French and that the language barrier disqualifies them from most government jobs.</p>
<p>Some support breaking away to form their own state.</p>
<p>In recent weeks opposition leaders from the English-speaking regions have been arrested.</p>
<p>Thousands of English-speaking teachers, lawyers, and students have gone on strike to protest against alleged marginalisation.</p>
<p>In response, internet service in English-speaking areas was cut off more than a week ago.</p>
<p>That, in turn, has led to a new campaign using the hashtag "Bring Back Our Internet".</p>
<p>The government says the internet blackout and arrests of political leaders are necessary to maintain peace.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for Cameroon?</p>
