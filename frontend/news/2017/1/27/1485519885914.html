<p>Manor's operating company Just Racing Services has been in administration since 6 January, and FRP Advisory has been unable to find a buyer.</p><p>Just Racing ceased trading on Friday, effectively ending the Manor team.</p><p>The staff were sent home on Friday and told they will be made redundant by the close of business on Tuesday after the payment of January salaries.</p><p>FRP said there was "no sustainable operational or financial structure in place to maintain the group as a going concern".</p><p>Joint administrator Geoff Rowley added the administration process "provided a moratorium" in the search for a buyer but "no solution could be achieved to allow for the business to continue in its current form".</p><p>It is not necessarily the end of Manor - a buyer could potentially still purchase the remnants of the team.</p><p>But even if that were to happen, the move makes it much harder for Manor to make it to the start of the season in Australia on 26 March.</p><p>The team's collapse leaves 10 teams - 20 cars - on the grid in Melbourne and comes just five days after the sport was <a href="/sport/formula1/38723001">taken over by US company Liberty Media</a> and long-time commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone was removed as chief executive.</p><p>Manor started life as Virgin Racing in 2010 and has been through several guises in the intervening seven years.</p><p>It previously <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-29784602">went into administration</a> in October 2014, and was only saved by current owner Stephen Fitzpatrick, the boss of energy firm Ovo, on the eve of the 2015 season.</p><p><a href="/sport/formula1/38123465">Fitzpatrick has said</a> the decisive moment was the team's <a href="/sport/formula1/constructors-world-championship/standings">slip to 11th place</a> in the constructors' championship as a result of Sauber's Felipe Nasr finishing ninth in the penultimate race of last season in Brazil. This cost the team in the region of $15m (&pound;12m) in prize money.</p><p>Manor were one of three new teams to enter F1 in 2010 after they were promised by then FIA president Max Mosley that a &pound;40m budget cap would be introduced.</p><p>But Mosley stood down as head of the governing body in 2009 after losing a fight with the teams over the plan and the cost limit was abandoned.  </p>
