<p>Live images on Globo television showed hundreds of inmates throwing rocks at each other and setting up barriers on Thursday inside the Alcacuz Penitentiary, outside the northeastern city of Natal.</p>

<p>Inmates appeared to be separating themselves into two groups with makeshift barriers of pieces of wood and other material. Injured prisoners were seen being carried off.</p>
<p>No prison guards could be seen.</p>
<p>Prison authorities did not immediately respond to emails and phone calls seeking information about the clash.</p>
<p>Confrontations between two gangs in the prison erupted over the weekend, resulting in the 26 deaths. Many of the dead were dismembered.</p>
<p>Authorities said members of the Sao Paulo-based First Command, Brazil's largest criminal gang, known by the Portuguese acronym PCC, fought with local gang Crime Syndicate of Rio Grande do Norte.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a heavily armed military police force entered the prison without violence. Authorities said they transferred 220 inmates to other prisons to avoid more clashes.</p>

<p>Brazil is experiencing a wave of prison killings from warring gangs. At least 126 people have died since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Security experts say the trigger was the break-up of a long truce last year between the PCC and Red Command, a large gang based in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>Previously, the two groups worked together to ensure a heavy flow of drugs and arms over Brazil's borders.</p>
<p>Five days later, PCC members killed 33 people at a Roraima state prison. Brutal scenes captured on a mobile phone video spread widely on social media, in which the inmates are seen hacking away at bodies in acts of revenge.</p>
