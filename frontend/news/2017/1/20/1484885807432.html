<p>Using advanced MRI nearly doubles the number of aggressive tumours that are caught.</p><p>And the trial on 576 men, <a href="http://press.thelancet.com/promisAPPX.pdf" class="story-body__link-external">published in the Lancet</a>, showed more than a quarter could be spared invasive biopsies, which can lead to severe side-effects.</p><p>The NHS is <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg175/resources/surveillance-report-2016-prostate-cancer-diagnosis-and-management-2014-nice-guideline-cg175-2671010607/chapter/Surveillance-decision" class="story-body__link-external">already reviewing</a> whether the scans can be introduced widely. </p><p>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in British men, and yet testing for it is far from perfect.</p><p>If men have high prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in the blood, they go for a biopsy. </p><p>Twelve needles then take random samples from the whole of the prostate. </p><p>It can miss a cancer that is there, fail to spot whether it is aggressive, and cause side-effects including bleeding, serious infections and erectile dysfunction.</p><p>"Taking a random biopsy from the breast would not be accepted, but we accept that in prostate," said Dr Hashim Ahmed, a consultant and one of the researchers.</p><p>Up to 120,000 men go through this every year in the UK.</p><p>The trial, at 11 hospitals in the UK, used multi-parametric MRI on men with high PSA levels.</p><p>It showed 27% of the men did not need a biopsy at all. </p><p>And 93% of aggressive cancers were detected by using the MRI scan to guide the biopsy compared with just 48% when the biopsy was done at random.</p><p>Dr Ahmed, who works at University College London Hospitals, told the BBC News website: "This is a significant step-change in the way we diagnose prostate cancer.</p><p>"We have to look at the long-term survival, but in my opinion by improving the detection of important cancers that are currently missed we could see a considerable impact.</p><p>"But that will need to be evaluated in future studies, and we may have to wait 10 to 15 years." </p><p>Chris first noticed the symptoms at the theatre a decade ago, when he needed to go to the toilet repeatedly.</p><p>Doctors found his prostate was enlarged. </p><p>In May last year, Chris needed to see his doctor again, as he was feeling tired a lot of the time.</p><p>Prostate cancer was suspected, and he was offered an MRI scan as part of the trial. </p><p>He says: "I'd heard from a friend that a prostate biopsy could be extremely painful and uncomfortable, so was pleased to know that I wouldn't be sent for one unless the doctors were confident I needed it."</p><p>In the end, he still needed a biopsy, and he was diagnosed with a cancer that had not spread out of the tumour.</p><p>He is now considering what to do about treatment.</p><p>The study, led by the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, is already being considered by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.</p><p>It will decide whether it is cost-effective to introduce multi-parametric MRI within the NHS.</p><p>Angela Culhane, the chief executive at Prostate Cancer UK, described the current system of testing as "notoriously imperfect".</p><p>She added: "This is the biggest leap forward in prostate cancer diagnosis in decades."</p><p>Prof Ros Eeles, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said the study was "very important" and "provides ground breaking data".</p><p>The chairman of the British Society of Urogenital Radiology, Dr Philip Haslam, said: "Today's findings represent a huge leap forward in prostate cancer diagnosis."</p><p>However, he warned the biggest issue could be the number of scanners and training people to interpret the results. </p>
