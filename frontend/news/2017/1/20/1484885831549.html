<p>After fending for himself on the streets, five-year-old Saroo made it to an orphanage, where he was adopted by Australian couple Sue and John Brierley to begin a new life in Tasmania.</p><p>Years later, as a young man, he yearned to discover more about his origins. So he began an ambitious Google Earth search that would prove to be fateful.</p><p>Now his story has been told in Lion, a Hollywood film starring <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-37415842" class="story-body__link">Dev Patel</a> and Nicole Kidman.</p><p>The image of Saroo's birth mother burned in his mind. He set out to find her with a laptop and unwavering determination.</p><p>It became an obsession. For years he pored over satellite photos night after night.</p><p>"I used mathematics and everything I could remember about the landmarks and the architecture of my home town," Saroo tells the BBC.</p><p>Then one day he found it. A dusty village in central India filled with childhood memories - the forest, the temple, a little bridge, a brick wall, the waterfall where he used to play. </p><p>Memories of his mother swirled. He wanted to tell her: "I know you looked for me, but I spent my whole life looking for you." </p><p>Saroo wrote down his experience - including what happened next - in a memoir that spawned Lion, which opens in the UK and Australia this week. It has already screened in the US, and is hoping to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37335879" class="story-body__link">generate awards buzz</a>.</p><p>"I never thought that something like this would come to someone like me. I'm a pretty laid-back kind of person," Saroo says.</p><p>"People are just so enthralled and enchanted by the movie." </p><p>When his book achieved success, Saroo took time out from his job selling industrial equipment in his father's business in Hobart. Now he has a packed schedule of film promotional tours. His life has changed again.</p><p>Saroo's adoptive mother, Sue, hopes the film could help transform other lives too.</p><p>"Sadly we've got a lot more war happening [now] and I believe there are just as many children wishing they could join a family," she says.</p><p>"They're orphans of war, and just abandoned in camps." Adoption should happen "a lot more", she says.</p><p>The film's cast has also supported fundraising to help the millions of children living on India's streets.</p><p>Nicole Kidman has said she was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38560832" class="story-body__link">moved to tears</a> by the film's "beautiful" depiction of an adoptive mother's love.</p><p>"I really admire her as an actress," says Sue. "She's Australian, she's an adoptive mother - we're really on the same page."</p><p>Slumdog Millionaire star Patel spent eight months honing his Australian accent, bulking up and growing his hair out for Lion.</p><p>"His devotion in this film has just been amazing," Saroo says.</p><p>As for himself, Saroo says he has returned to India more than a dozen times, but Tasmania remains home.</p>
