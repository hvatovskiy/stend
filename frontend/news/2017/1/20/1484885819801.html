<p>Shelley Jack, 26, was being driven by husband Alexander, 30, from their Inverallochy home to Aberdeen after contractions started.</p><p>However, before they could make it, their baby son was born in their Mitsubishi Outlander - near Donald Trump's Aberdeenshire golf resort.</p><p>They then continued the journey. Baby Lucas is now home and doing fine.</p><p>The unusual birth happened in the early hours of 10 January.</p><p>Mrs Jack told BBC Scotland: "I went to my bed as normal. But I woke up with stomach cramps, woke my husband to tell him I thought something was happening, and started to pace round the room.</p><p>"I started to panic as I am a bit of a worrier with stuff like that and told my husband to phone Aberdeen maternity.</p><p>"The midwife on the phone told us to come straight through."</p><p>She continued: "We got in the car. About 15 minutes from our house I had no space between my contractions at all. </p><p>"I said, I'm sure they aren't supposed to go this quick.</p><p>"I was trying to move about the seat to relieve the pain but nothing shifted it. My husband saw the pain I was in and started to drive faster but kept trying to assure me that I'd only just started and I would get there in time to get pain relief if I wanted."</p><p>Mrs Jack went on: "My waters popped round about Ellon and from there I knew this wasn't normal and the baby was trying to come out.</p><p>"I screamed to my husband to phone an ambulance as I felt my body starting to push something out and the pain was horrendous at this point.</p><p>"He phoned the midwife back. She also told me that if I felt my body pushing that I wouldn't be able to control it and that I would have to take off my trousers and just let the baby come.</p><p>"I thought this was absolutely crazy - who has a baby in their car on their own?</p><p>"I wouldn't give in - probably in denial that this would actually happen - but somewhere between the Trump golf course and the Cock and Bull restaurant I realised this baby really was coming out and I did what the midwife told me to do and the baby came out with a few pushes.</p><p>"I caught him in my hands and cradled him into my chest. My whole body was shaking uncontrollably.</p><p>"My husband by this point was hysterical as I think he didn't realise I was actually being serious when I said the baby was coming out."</p><p>They then carried on their journey to hospital, where baby Lucas was tended to.</p><p>He weighed in at 7lbs 5oz.</p><p>His mother added: "Baby Lucas is settling into our family really well and his one-year-old big brother Jensen is just delighted with his baby, giving him lots of kisses and cuddles.</p>
