<p>When students awoke after the 19-hour bus trip from Talladega, Alabama, one of the first scenes that greeted their bleary eyes in the nation's capital was Senator Bernie Sanders, waiting to cross the street. </p><p>It was a sight few of the Talladega College marching band members thought they'd ever see - a former presidential candidate strolling to work - as the vast majority had never even been outside the state of Alabama.</p><p>"They're so talented, these young people. We're really excited to give them this opportunity," said Dr Sharon Whittaker-Davis, the school's vice-president of student affairs, as she watched the students pour out of the buses and into the African American Civil War Museum in Washington. "We're here."</p><p>The night before, the mayor of tiny Talladega and a crowd of about 100 well-wishers cheered as the buses pulled out of town. It was a loving send-off that contrasted sharply with the treatment the band had faced in previous weeks. </p><p>Several other high schools and colleges, including historically black institutions like Howard University, declined the invitation or didn't even apply to play at Donald Trump's inauguration. </p><p>As soon as it was announced that the Marching Tornadoes was the sole black college to accept, they were called sell-outs, race traitors and worse. </p><p>The college president received demands for his resignation, and then death threats. Alumni begged their alma mater not to go.</p><p>"Please do not march in this. Stand with people of colour against racism," one comment read on the band's Facebook page.</p><p>However, after college president Barry Hawkins appeared on Fox News to explain his decision to let the band perform, donations to a GoFundMe page raising money for the trip shot through the roof, soaring to <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/great-tornado-to-inaugural-parade" class="story-body__link-external">almost $650,000</a> (Â£527,000). </p><p>The extra money will go towards scholarships, new band uniforms, new instruments and a new practice space - the college has only 700 students, almost all of whom receive some type of financial aid. </p><p>Many of the band members come from low-income backgrounds and are the first in their families to attend college.</p><p>The students were eager about the invitation and took the ensuing backlash personally.</p><p>"I just couldn't understand why they would do that to us," said 21-year-old alto saxophone player Eriel House. </p><p>"We're students. We're not involved in a political party. We just wanted to go show our talents."</p><p>"[He's president] regardless," said Shylexis Robinson. "I just want to march on Pennsylvania Avenue, period."</p><p>Once in Washington, the trip organisers had hoped to take the students straight to the Martin Luther King Memorial on the National Mall.</p><p>But because streets were already blocked off for the inauguration, they instead headed to the African American Civil War Museum - a tribute to the black soldiers who fought for the Union. </p><p>Talladega College itself was founded in 1867 by the descendants of slaves.</p><p>Inside the darkened museum, the students swished around in their matching blue-and-crimson tracksuits, peering into display cases of rusty slaves' shackles, a yellowed 1862 copy of the New York Times announcing the "preliminary emancipation" of slaves, and a sign that reads: "We Serve Colored Carry Out Only".</p><p>When Mr Hawkins announced to the group that a special guest awaited the students across the street, a student said: "Obama?"</p><p>Instead, Omarosa Manigault - former Apprentice star, director of Mr Trump's African-American outreach during the campaign, and now his director of communications - waited beside a statue of four black Union soldiers. </p><p>Students clamoured for selfies.</p><p>"You have shown and exhibited such great courage... we can't move forward unless we are together," Ms Manigault called out.</p><p>"On behalf of the president, Donald J Trump, I want to just thank you, welcome you here and I cannot wait to see y'all show up and show out tomorrow at the inauguration parade!"</p><p>Milling around the memorial, Melissa Harris traced her hand along the names inscribed on the monument. </p><p>"I think I found one of my ancestors on one of these walls," she said. </p><p>"I hope we get to meet President Obama," another girl sighed. </p><p>"I don't think it's hitting us yet that he's going," said Marissa Melchor quietly.</p><p>"He's not dying," her friend said rolling her eyes. </p><p>"It feels unreal," Ms Melchor replied. "But reality is going to hit us."</p><p>The students piled back onto the buses and took a long, slow ride through packed traffic to the University of the District of Columbia campus. </p><p>There the students got their first meal since the previous day, and listened to remarks from local business people who donated to their GoFundMe campaign. </p><p>None of the students who spoke to BBC News expressed a strong support for incoming President Trump, but they seemed cautiously optimistic.</p><p>"I don't like everything about him. I think it's going to be a pretty interesting couple of years," said Bernard Norris, an 18-year-old trombone player. </p><p>"I just wish him the best of luck and I hope he does the country right... I hope something good comes out of this."</p><p>In the hallway outside the dining hall, 21-year-old first chair trumpeteer Marco Vera said that even though he is excited to perform, it was hard to hear some of the remarks Mr Trump made during the campaign. </p><p>"Coming from a Hispanic background, having to see my parents struggle through everything to get where we're at... it hurts," he said.</p>
