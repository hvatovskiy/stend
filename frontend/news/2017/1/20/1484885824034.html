<p>Until this year, secondary school performance has been judged mainly by what proportion of pupils get five GCSEs at grade A*-C, including English and maths.</p><p>Instead two new measures, known as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/561003/Progress-8-school-performance-measure-18-Oct.pdf.pdf" class="story-body__link-external"> Attainment 8</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/561003/Progress-8-school-performance-measure-18-Oct.pdf.pdf" class="story-body__link-external">Progress 8</a>, have been adopted.</p><p>These will now be used by the government to judge whether schools are performing adequately.</p><p>For many years, teachers and heads had complained that to judge a school by its results in five GCSEs alone was unfair, because it did not offer broader information about the ability of the pupils being taught.</p><p>Obviously if a high-achieving child comes to a school, it will not take as much effort to get them to a good GCSE grade as it would a lower-achieving child.</p><p>So schools which were working with more challenging pupils with low prior attainment were effectively marked down in the league tables, because this extra challenge was not considered.</p><p>There was also concern that the benchmark only assessed pupils who got results at grade C and above. The new measure takes into account achievement from grades A*-G.</p><p>Tap <a href="http://bbc.in/2h0UXN5" class="story-body__link-external">here</a> to search for the results for your area.</p><p>In basic terms, it aims to measure how well a school is serving its pupils by looking at where they started and where they end up.</p><p>It does this by looking at attainment in eight GCSE, or equivalent, subjects from grade A*-G for each pupil. </p><p>These results are then compared against the results of other pupils who came into secondary schools nationally with the same attainment levels.</p><p>A figure for those results across the school year group is then calculated. This result is then set within confidence levels, which set out how accurate the government believes the Progress 8 score is.</p><p>Progress 8 scores generally fall somewhere between -1 and 1.</p><p>The number (which is pretty abstract to all but the statisticians, as Progress 8 scores generally fall somewhere between -1 and 1) is then placed into one of five bands: </p><p>It is these bandings which will be of most use to parents.</p><p>Attainment 8 is about the raw results across individual pupils' best eight subjects.</p><p>But they are not just any old subjects. English and maths are compulsory - and worth double points.</p><p>Then there is the choice of three subjects from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-baccalaureate-ebacc/english-baccalaureate-ebacc" class="story-body__link-external">English Baccalaureate</a> (core academic subjects), and any other three from the DfE's approved list of qualifications - including vocational qualifications.</p><p>The results are only recorded at the school level and an average score per pupil is calculated and published.</p><p>The maximum number of points per school is 80 points per pupil. The national average across all state secondary school is 49.9 this year.</p><p>The short answer is that it is thought to be fairer to see a pupil's best achievement across a broader spectrum of subjects.</p><p>Teachers and head teachers had complained that the five good GCSEs measure was too narrow.</p><p>They also argued that the more recently introduced English Baccalaureate was too prescriptive and only relevant for the more academic students.</p><p>If attainment across a broader range of subjects are be counted, then arts subjects and vocational qualifications count for something in school accountability as well.</p><p>This has been a key concern, because the new measures are more complicated to read than the old tables based on five GCSE scores.</p><p>Progress 8 scores are far more abstract in that they generally fall somewhere between -1 and 1.</p><p>However, there are some figures in brackets below each score on the tables which measure how confident statisticians are that the figure above is accurate.</p><p>When the DfE trialled the new measures on panels of parents, many were confused by these scores and so the banded descriptions were introduced to aid understanding.</p><p>Secondary head teachers say that while is important for parents to look at a school's Progress 8 score, they should focus broadly on the descriptions such as "above average".</p><p>Parents may also wish to look at schools' Attainment 8 scores to have an overall idea of how they  perform on GCSE results.</p><p>School performance measures are used just as much by officials to monitor standards and ultimately Progress 8 is an accountability measure.</p><p>A school is considered potentially failing if its Progress 8 score falls in the well below average band. </p><p>No, these new measures apply to England only.</p><p>However, there have been changes in terms of school accountability recently in Wales and Scotland.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-38302299" class="story-body__link">Data on how well Scottish pupils do</a> in reading, writing and numeracy was published for the first time, as part of a new Curriculum for Excellence.</p><p>The Welsh Assembly has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-31030320" class="story-body__link">recently reintroduced the publication of performance information,</a> after abolishing it in 2001, in an attempt to raise standards.</p><p>Schools are now given a colour code - green, yellow, amber or red - according to how well they are performing.</p>
