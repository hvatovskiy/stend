<p>Its backers hope it will be the first of many, heralding a modern-day revival of the fabled Silk Road trade route linking Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The "East Wind" train line carried products worth nearly $5m on its maiden journey to Europe, including clothes, suitcases, purses and wallets - all loaded onto 34 wagons.</p>
<p>On the return journey, it will haul British machinery, Spanish hams and cheeses, and German beer.</p>
<p>The term "Silk Road" evokes ancient images of merchants travelling in dusty caravans on journeys taking months.</p>
<p>The modern rail version offers companies the chance to move goods between the continents for about half the cost of air transportation - and, in two weeks, less travel time than that offered by the quickest sea route.</p>
<p>But there are logistical complications.</p>
<p>The containers have to be unloaded and placed on different wagons at various points along the trip, because of different track gauges in some of the countries the train crosses.</p>
<p>So, how effective will this new route be for trade?</p>
