<p>Mahmoud Hussein, an Egyptian national and journalist with more than two decades of experience, was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/egypt-arrests-al-jazeera-news-producer-vacation-161223171209633.html"> arrested on December 20 </a> after arriving at Cairo's international airport for vacation.</p>
<p><span> On January 4, when his detention was set to expire, </span><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/egypt-extends-detention-al-jazeera-journalist-170104072305709.html">authorities extended his arrest</a><span> for a period of 15 days "pending a further investigation." His detention was again extended on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p>Five days after his arrest, Egypt's interior ministry accused him of "incitement against state institutions and broadcasting false news with the aim of spreading chaos".</p>
<p>Al Jazeera rejects the charges against Hussein and calls on Egypt to release him <span>immediately </span> .</p>
<p>"Al Jazeera deems all accusations against Hussein, including those which might be added later to the current allegations, to be a result of practices which violate international norms and conventions, and which, unfortunately, prevail in Egypt as exposed by human rights organisations," the network has said in a statement.</p>

<p>Hussein, who lives in the Qatar's capital, Doha, joined Al Jazeera in Egypt in 2011. He had moved to the network's headquarters in Qatar in 2013.</p>

<p> The journalist's defence team said on Monday that Egyptian authorities denied him the right to contact his lawyers and see his family members.</p>
<p>Hussein has complained of suffering constant mistreatment, being denied of his legal rights, and being kept in an individual cell that does not permit the entry of food or clothing.</p>

<p>Commenting on Hussein's arrest, the United Nations has previously called on the Egyptian authorities to comply with their commitments to protect freedom of expression.</p>
<p><span>Stephane Dujarric, s</span>pokesperson for the UN secretary general, said the world body has been following the latest developments in Hussein's case.</p>
<p>"We appeal for this case to be resolved in accordance with Egypt's own international obligations to protect freedom of expression and freedom of opinion," he said in a press briefing statement on January 6.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera News</span></p>
