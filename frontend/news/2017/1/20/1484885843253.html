<p><span>Ash Carter, the </span>US defense secretary, said on Thursday that some of the ISIL fighters were believed to be actively planning attacks against targets in Europe, without offering any details. </p>
<p>"We need to strike ISIL everywhere they show up," <span>Carter said on his last day office</span>.</p>
<p>"And that's particularly true in view of the fact that we know some of the ISIL operatives in Libya were involved with plotting attacks." </p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, Peter Cook, the Pentagon's press secretary, said the attacks were authorised by outgoing US president Barack Obama and were in conjunction with Libya's United Nations-backed government of national accord.</p>

<p>The group took advantage of conflict between various factions of former rebels who emerged as powerbrokers after Gaddafi was killed in 2011.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
