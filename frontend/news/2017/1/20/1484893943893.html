The car was not submerged and I waited for the rescuers to arrive."</p><p>Mr Parete, who was taken to hospital with a fellow survivor, continued to make phone calls but it reportedly took until 20:00 before his pleas were acted on by the authorities.  </p><p>A <a href="http://www.lastampa.it/2017/01/19/italia/cronache/slavina-sullhotel-chi-sono-le-vittime-e-i-dispersi-StH5DxDNabcamuo8AsI5XN/pagina.html" class="story-body__link-external">list of 23</a> names given by La Stampa newspaper suggests that most are Italians but they include a Swiss national and a Romanian.</p><p>Three are children aged six, seven and nine, and the oldest person on the list is a man of 60.   </p><p>Seven of the missing are from the neighbouring region of Marche.</p><p>A couple from Marche who are not recorded in La Stampa's list, Marco Vagnarelli and Paola Tomassini, were last heard from at 16:30 on Wednesday, when Marco contacted his brother Fulvio on WhatsApp, Ansa reports.

A succession of quakes like this is often how the geology works.</p><p>The big picture is reasonably well understood. Wider tectonic forces in the Earth's crust have led to the Apennines being pulled apart at a rate of roughly 3mm per year - about a 10th of the speed at which your fingernails grow.</p><p>But this stress is then spread across a multitude of different faults that cut through the mountains. And this network is fiendishly complicated.</p><p>It does now look as though August's event broke two neighbouring faults, starting on one known as the Laga and then jumping across to one called the Vettore.</p><p>Then came October with a swathe of quakes that broke the rest of the Vetorre. But the stress, according to the seismologists, wasn't just sent north, it was loaded south as well - south of August's event. </p><p>And it's in this zone that we have now seen a series of quakes in recent days. About a dozen magnitude fours and fives. </p>
