<p>Gwen, 24, from Pennsylvania, hosted an "ask me anything" (AMA) session on the online community site Reddit.</p><p>She received almost 2,000 questions and comments, mostly from "supportive and respectful people".</p><p>"I figure very few of you know trans people in your everyday lives and might be afraid to ask questions at the risk of offending someone, so I thought I'd give you all the opportunity to learn from someone who will answer your invasive questions," she said.</p><p>One Redditor wrote: "I think you just won over half of Reddit right there."</p><p>Another said: "You're very beautiful, and I'm glad you found the happiness that you were searching for. Thanks for sharing with us."</p><p>In this video, Gwen responds to some of the questions she was asked. </p><p>Gwen, who medically transitioned using hormone replacement therapy, started dreaming about becoming a woman when she was five years old.</p><p>"I would wake up from those dreams and feel so happy. It was weird because I looked like a boy and everyone told me I was a boy," she said.</p><p>"When I was 10, someone at school asked what people look like in heaven, and our teacher said, 'You can look however you like.'</p><p>"I was so excited. I couldn't wait to die because then I could look like a girl. I wasn't suicidal, but I thought someone had just unlocked the secret for me."</p><p>At the age of 22, Gwen began her medical transition. </p><p>Two years later, most people she meets can't tell she was born male. </p><p>"As a guy, it was lonely because people were nice but didn't really engage with me. </p><p>"If I was walking home late at night, I could tell if when a woman was uncomfortable with my presence.</p><p>"Now, I get catcalled a lot walking through the city, and I fully understand the mindset. </p><p>"You get way more attention as a woman, and you assume that anybody could be a threat."</p><p>Gwen also notices sexist remarks.</p><p>"You don't really understand it until you experience it for yourself.</p><p>"I get lots of comments like, 'You wouldn't know because you're a girl.'</p><p>"I grew up as a guy, so I do know, I know a lot of these things."</p><p>But she said one of the positives about living as a woman was how other women treat her.</p><p>"They're much more comfortable around me and compliment me on my hair, make-up or clothes."</p><p>"Men go out of their way to hold doors for me or ask me if I need help."</p><p>Gwen explained that, as well as reducing hair growth and redistributing fat to her hips and chest, the structure of her muscles had changed.</p><p>"I went down three shoe sizes because the muscles in my foot changed, and I shrunk in height because of the curvature of my spine," she said.</p><p>"I lost all my strength. Before, I'd always win in a hand wrestle with my sister or girlfriend. Now, they'd probably beat me."</p><p>The transition process was an "awkward phase" for Gwen, and she felt people were uncomfortable with her appearance. </p><p>"You don't look like a man, but you don't look like a woman either, and people don't know how to talk to you.</p><p>"I suffered a lot in that period because I felt I was a fake because I didn't look like other women did. </p><p>"I had to tell myself that there's no one way for a woman to look."</p><p>Gwen finally felt that she "passed" as a woman after a man made sexual advances on a train. </p><p>"My heart froze. For a split second, I was happy that a stranger had seen me as a woman for the first time. </p><p>"Then I immediately felt disgusted, uncomfortable and guilty for the attention."</p><p>Although one of her uncles refuses to speak to her since the transition, Gwen feels that most of her family has accepted her.</p><p>"My mum had to relearn a lot about me and there are things she had to get used to, like the fact that we'll never have a mother-son dance. </p><p>"We're much closer now though, because I feel more authentic."</p><p>Gwen also discussed her personal life, although she said most trans people preferred not to be asked intimate questions.</p><p>"My girlfriend has always made me feel OK with my body, and I enjoy sex a lot more because now I actually get to be myself," she said.</p><p>"It's more pleasurable, and I feel it all over my body. </p><p>"I can still use my penis but I prefer not to."</p><p>Surgery is a consideration for the future.</p><p>"If my girlfriend and I stay together and we want children, I need things to stay as they are right now. </p><p>"After we have kids, I'd like to have surgery. </p><p>"That's the only thing holding me back because I hate having it."</p><p>"I'm a person like any other. Being trans is just a part of my medical history," Gwen told Reddit.</p><p>"People feel they need to walk on eggshells around trans people, and it keeps them from wanting to learn anything about us.</p><p>"But being friends with a trans person isn't all that different from being friends with anyone else, and it can be rewarding to have a different perspective on life.</p><p>"I love everything about me that makes me 'me', it was just my body I was unhappy with.</p><p>"Now that my body matches how it was supposed to look in my brain, I'm happy."</p><p>Join the debate on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCLifestyleHealth/" class="story-body__link-external">Facebook page.</a></p><p><strong>Gwen is happy to answer your questions on transgender issues.
