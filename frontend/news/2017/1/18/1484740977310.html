<p><span>A government spokesman said on Saturday </span>11 Eritrean female captives, a Turk, and an Egyptian were released after a battle to recapture a part of the city held by ISIL.</p>
<p>Sirte fell to the armed group more than a year ago after its fighters took advantage of infighting that emerged among Libya's rival factions following the 2011 <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/10/20111020111520869621.html">fall of Muammar Gaddafi</a>.</p>
<p><span>Forces allied with Libya's UN-backed Government of National Unity began an offensive on May 12.</span></p>
<p>After a six-month campaign of street-by-street fighting backed by US air strikes, Libyan forces have taken back most of Sirte, where ISIL fighters are holding out with snipers, boobytraps and car bombs.</p>
<p>"The forces have completely recaptured the 600 block area in Sirte from gangs of Daesh [Arabic acronym for ISIL], and now the Ghiza Bahriya area is the last pocket of resistance," said Rida Issa, a spokesperson for the pro-government forces.</p>

<p>Forces fighting ISIL in Sirte are mostly from nearby Misrata, whose brigades are among the most powerful in Libya. They are allied with the UN-backed unity government in Tripoli that is trying to unite competing factions.</p>
<p>Western nations back the unity government hoping it will bring stability and help counter ISIL, as well as refugee-and-migrant smugglers. But Tripoli leaders have struggled to extend their influence. </p>
