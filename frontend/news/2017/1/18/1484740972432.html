<p>Judge Henry Claude Louis-Jean said the jail break occurred on Saturday in Arcahaie, a coastal town about 50km north of Haiti's capital <span>Port-au-Prince.</span></p>
<p>Police in the Caribbean nation have set up checkpoints on roads leading from the jail and detained several people without identity cards.</p>
<p>However, the 266 inmates of Arcahaie prison do not wear uniforms, making it easier for the escapees to hide from authorities.</p>
<p>Eleven inmates were caught during the jail break, which happened when some prisoners were released in to a relatively less secure area for bathing.</p>

<p>The inmates broke into an area used by the guards, stealing at least five rifles among other weapons.</p>
<p>One guard was shot to death.</p>
<p><span>Camille Edouard Junior, </span>Haiti's justice minister, said one inmate also died during the jail break after falling off a wall and hitting his head.</p>
<p>"One guard was killed during the incident," Edouard Junior told Reuters news agency. "Three prisoners were wounded, including one who died as a consequence of his wounds."</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the escape, videos circulating online showed the guard's bloodied body lying on the floor surrounded by escapees' discarded sandals.</p>
<p>The government condemned what it called a "mutiny provoked by heavily armed individuals", according to a statement quoted by the news website Vant Bef.</p>
<p>Police asked residents of the coastal area to follow authorities' instructions as a manhunt intensified.</p>

<p><span>It was not clear if any of the inmates had been recaptured by Saturday evening.</span></p>
<p>Haiti experienced another major jail break <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2014/08/run-after-haiti-jailbreak-201481142836671597.html">only two years ago</a> when a gang attacked the Croix-des-Bouquets prison and freed hundreds of inmates.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the country was devastated by Hurricane Matthew.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/haiti-death-toll-hurricane-matthew-passes-1000-161010042033130.html">More than 1,000 people were killed</a> when Matthew crashed ashore on October 4 as a Category 4 storm, carrying winds of 230km per hour.</p>
<p>According to the UN, 1.4 million people are in urgent need of help in Haiti.</p>
<p>Haiti's Civil Protection Department says more than 500 people are also infected with cholera.</p>
