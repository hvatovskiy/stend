<p><span>London-based Amnesty International has denounced the initial trial as a "travesty of justice".</span></p>
<p>The Court of Cassation also upheld sentences against eight of his co-defendants, including seven who received the same prison term, and one sentenced to 10 years in prison, a judicial official said.</p>

<p>Morsi was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/04/egypt-morsi-sentenced-150421063227546.html" target="_blank">convicted in April 2015</a> of involvement in deadly clashes outside the presidential palace during his one year in power.</p>
<p>His supporters and protesters had clashed after he issued a decree that placed his decisions beyond judicial review, sparking anger that culminated in mass protests against him in June and July 2013.</p>
<p>The military deposed him on July 3 that year, and he has faced several trials since. </p>
<p><span>Morsi was overthrown by then-army chief and now President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi following the street demonstrations.</span></p>
<p>Morsi - Egypt's first democratically elected president - faces charges in other cases, including allegedly leaking secrets to Qatar, conspiring with Hamas - <span>the Palestinian rulers of Gaza -</span> to destabilise Egypt, and organising a jailbreak during the 2011 uprising against then-president Hosni Mubarak.</p>

<p>Morsi's lawyers are appealing a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/05/egypt-sentences-mohammed-morsi-death-150516091845111.html" target="_blank">death sentence</a> in one of his trials on charges of participating in prison breaks and violence against policemen during the 2011 uprising that toppled Mubarak.</p>
<p>His Muslim Brotherhood group has been blacklisted and targeted in a crackdown that has killed hundreds of his supporters and jailed thousands.</p>
