<p>Yiannis Lagos, an MP with the Golden Dawn far-right outfit, and other party members hurled abuse and acted with aggressive behaviour towards teachers at the state-run elementary school in Perama, Greece's education ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Today's acts by the Golden Dawn members ... will not affect the operation of the school for the refugee children," said Yiannis Pantis, the ministry's general secretary.</p>

<p>"Instances of violence and racism have no place in a school environment."</p>
<p>Golden Dawn, an anti-immigrant party, is the third biggest political player in Greece, a country still struggling after more than six years of deepening recession.</p>
<p>The party has taken advantage of a protest vote against domestic political failures and internationally imposed austerity, polling just 0.3 percent in 2009 to winning almost seven percent in the country's last general election in 2015.</p>
<p>Many of its MPs, including Lagos, and other party members are <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/04/greece-trial-golden-dawn-150420081447112.html">facing trial</a> on charges that Golden Dawn is run as a criminal organisation.</p>
<p>They have now been freed after the expiration of an 18-month imprisonment period without trial.</p>
<h2>'Punches, abuse'</h2>
<p>The Golden Dawn members entered the school during a meeting between local officials, teachers and parents who were scheduled to discuss plans to offer after school classes to 25 refugee children who live in a nearby camp.</p>
<p>After storming the school, the Golden Dawn members threatened those attending the meeting and punched some teachers and parents, according to Greek media reports.</p>
<p>Witnesses also alleged that police stood outside the school, but failed to act to prevent the attack.</p>
<p>"Today's attack by Golden Dawn against parents and teachers in Perama, led by indicted MP Lagos, is a provocation for the entire Greek society," Takis Giannopoulos, a member of the Greek activist group Anti-Nazi Zone, told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>"Golden Dawn denies education to 25 children who escaped war.</p>
<p>"This fascism cannot be tolerated."</p>
<p>The attack was also condemned by several Greek political parties.</p>
<p>An estimated 62,000 refugees and migrants are currently stranded in Greece following a wave of border closures across Europe after a controversial agreement between the European Union and Turkey in March 2016.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera News</span></p>
