<p>Both sides are blaming each other for violating a ceasefire which began on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The UN wants to extend that truce for another 72 hours but the violence is continuing.</p>
<p>The Arab coalition forces say Houthi rebels fired rockets that hit a school in Jizan City along Saudi Arabia's border.</p>
<p>The rebels accuse their rivals of launching air strikes in Yemen's Saada province, which is also situated at the border.</p>
<p>The ceasefire was supposed to allow in aid to ease the dire humanitarian crisis. It was also a way to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict.</p>
<p>But what will it take to bring peace? And how will this conflict impact the region?</p>
