<p>The decision on Tuesday paves the way for <span>Abdul Hakim Belhadj </span>to take legal action against the then-UK foreign secretary, Jack Straw, and officials from Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, also known as MI6.</p>
<p>The country's top judges unanimously dismissed the government claim of sovereign immunity and cited England's medieval constitutional document, the Magna Carta, in their judgement.</p>
<p>"No free man shall be taken, or imprisoned, or dispossessed, of his ... liberties ... or be outlawed, or exiled, or in anyway destroyed," the cited text read.</p>
<p>Belhadj says he and his family were kidnapped in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur in 2004 by CIA agents and then transferred to a "black site" in Thailand's Bangkok before being transferred to Libya, then ruled by Muammar Gaddafi.</p>
<h2>UK-Libya rapprochement</h2>
<p>Britain's MI6 is believed to have been involved in the kidnapping and provided the intelligence necessary for the operation to take place.</p>
<p>The incident occurred during a rapprochement between Western states and Libya, which had until then been considered a pariah state by the US and the UK.</p>
<p>Belhadj, who was accused by Gaddafi of being involved in armed groups, spent several years in a Libyan prison before he was freed as part of an amnesty deal in 2010.</p>
<p>Belhadj took up arms the following year as part of a popular uprising, backed by Western powers, that overthrew Gaddafi in 2011.</p>
<p>Information about the British role in Belhadj's kidnapping came to light when Gaddafi's intelligence service offices were ransacked by the rebels.</p>

<p>Responding to the judgement, Straw said the accusations of his involvement were yet to be proven in court.</p>
<p>"This judgment is about some important points of law, related to how far it is possible to bring into a court process in the UK actions of sovereign states abroad," he said.</p>
<p>"However, at no stage so far have the merits of the applicant's case been tested before any court. That can only happen when the trial of the action itself takes place."</p>
<p>Straw said that as "foreign secretary I acted at all times in a manner which was fully consistent with my legal duties, and with national and international law.</p>
<p>"I was never in any way complicit in the unlawful rendition or detention of anyone by other states."</p>
<h2>Symbolic compensation</h2>
<p>Belhadj, who is now a politician, has offered to drop the case for symbolic compensation of one pound ($1.20) and a formal apology from the British government.</p>
<p>"The government bought years of delay by wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds on this appeal, when a simple apology would have closed the case," said Cori Crider, a lawyer for Reprieve, an advocacy group that represents victims of the US rendition programme.</p>
<p>"Theresa May [the UK prime minister] should apologise to this family, draw a line in the sand against torture, and restore British honour once and for all."</p>
<p>Hundreds of people suspected by the US government of being involved in "terrorism" were kidnapped and imprisoned in black sites across the world, in a programme commonly known as extraordinary rendition.</p>

<p>Targets would be kidnapped by intelligence officers and taken to sites in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, among others.</p>
<p>On several occasions, the US is known to have kidnapped people who have later been proven innocent.</p>
