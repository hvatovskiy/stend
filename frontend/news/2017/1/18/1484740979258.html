<p>It says it will withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) - which was set up to prosecute those accused of serious crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>Several African states have accused the ICC of unfairly targeting the continent. Uganda's president went so far as to call it "useless".</p>
<p>South Africa's decision comes a year after it was criticised for ignoring an order to arrest Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir while he was visiting the country.</p>
<p>The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Bashir, who is accused of committing war crimes in Sudan's Darfur region.</p>
<p>So is the ICC biased against African nations?</p>
