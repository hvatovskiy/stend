<p>Brigadier General Adel Ragaei, who commanded an armoured division deployed in the Sinai, died in a hail of bullets on Saturday, as he left his home in the Obour City suburb, according to his sister-in-law Huda Zein Elabedine and his wife <span>Samia Zain Elabedine.</span></p>
<p>Fighters in Egypt have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers, mostly in the Sinai Peninsula, but such attacks on senior officers are rare.</p>
<p>Ragaei's wife told the Reuters news agency how she witnessed his death.</p>
<p>"Minutes after he left the house I heard gunfire, I went out to find him covered in blood ... he received a lot of bullets .. He died instantly," she said, adding that neighbors told her the assailants had automatic weapons and fled in a car.</p>
<p>"At 6am (04:00 GMT) they killed him. I can't tell you if it was six or 12 bullets. It was before he could get into his car," the AFP news agency quoted Ragaei's sister-in-law as saying.</p>
<p><span>A military official told AFP that the officer had indeed been "martyred", but he did not provide further details.</span></p>
<p>According to media sources close to Al Jazeera, Ragaei oversaw the destruction and flooding of tunnels that ran into the Gaza Strip under the Rafah border, which <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/gaza-palestinians-egypt-teaching-israel-tricks-151028091104982.html" target="_blank">provided a lifeline for residents</a> of the besieged territory. </p>
<h2><strong>Armed groups in Egypt</strong></h2>
<p><span>An armed group called Liwa al-Thawra claimed the attack, in a message posted on Twitter, AFP reported, but the message has yet to be independently verified.</span></p>
<p>The largest Arab country is currently battling <a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2015/01/major-attacks-egypt-150130161541922.html" target="_blank">several armed groups mainly concentrated in the Sinai Peninsula</a> and which gained pace after the military coup that ousted Mohamed Morsi, the country's first democratically elected president.</p>
<p>The campaign, which has included the Egyptian branch of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group, has killed hundreds of soldiers and police.</p>
<p><span>One group, which calls itself the Hasam Movement, has </span><a class="internallink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/egypt-hasam-claims-killing-gamal-al-deb-police-161008140507921.html" target="_blank">claimed several attacks</a><span> in or near Cairo, including the assassination of a police officer and the attempted killing of a senior prosecutor.</span></p>
<p>The attacks have dented the recovery of tourism after a 2011 uprising drove away tourists, a major source of hard currency.</p>
<p>Import-dependent Egypt is facing a shortage of foreign exchange that has stifled business activity and hit confidence in the economy.</p>
