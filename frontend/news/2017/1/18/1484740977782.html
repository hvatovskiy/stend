<p><span>Researchers from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US state of Tennessee last month announced they "serendipitously" developed a catalyst that transformed carbon dioxide (CO2), a main greenhouse gas, into high yields of ethanol - without the use of rare and expensive elements such as platinum.</span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2011/11/2011115115514407711.html">Ethanol</a>, produced from organic matter such as corn or sugar, is the most widely used biofuel in the world.</p>
<p>Many countries, including the United States and China, are increasingly attempting to make ethanol a mainstream fuel while cutting the use of fossil fuels, which are blamed for the vast majority of harmful gas emissions driving climate change.</p>
<p>According to the Oak Ridge scientists, tiny particles of carbon and copper, as well as nitrogen and electrical currents, helped trigger a chemical reaction that unexpectedly <span>converted CO2 into ethanol. </span></p>
<p>The researchers had been attempting to discover a series of chemical reactions that would revert carbon dioxide - a byproduct of fuel consumption - back to a fuel. They found the first step in the process not only worked, but even cheaply and efficiently produced ethanol.</p>
<p>"We're taking carbon dioxide, a waste product of combustion, and we're pushing that combustion reaction backwards with very high selectivity to a useful fuel," Adam Rondinone, a lead author of the team's study published in the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/slct.201601169/full" target="_blank">online journal ChemistrySelect</a>, said in a <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/nano-spike-catalysts-convert-carbon-dioxide-directly-ethanol" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>"Ethanol was a surprise - it's extremely difficult to go straight from carbon dioxide to ethanol with a single catalyst."</p>

<p>The researchers plan to conduct further tests to determine how their conversion technique could be used to produce ethanol on an industrial scale.</p>
<p>The breakthrough announcement, released on October 12, also suggested the process could be combined with other renewables, such as solar or wind power, to more efficiently harness those energy sources.</p>
<p>Excess electricity produced by wind and solar is often lost when it is stored in batteries. </p>
<p>However, by applying the new discovery, this excess electricity could be used to produce ethanol to power solar factories and turbines when there's insufficient sun and wind, the scientists say.</p>
<p>"This could help to balance a grid supplied by intermittent renewable sources," Rondinone said. </p>

<p>Dr Jeremy Martin - a senior scientist and fuels expert from the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science-based advocacy organisation - told Al Jazeera the Oak Ridge team's discovery could be a "building block" towards creating a low-carbon energy system.</p>
<p>"This work is building the foundation for a chemical industry that runs on electricity and CO2, which can help us build a zero-carbon economy. Improving yield and efficiency and developing catalysts that do not require rare elements is critical to scaling these processes up cost effectively," said Martin.</p>
<p>"The contribution of such a process to reducing pollution depends on having abundant clean electricity. We are making progress in this area, but we still have a lot of work to do."</p>
