<p>Barack Obama's outgoing administration announced the contribution of $500m (£406m; €468m) on Tuesday, bringing the total funds to date to $1bn.</p><p>Mr Obama pledged in 2014 to give $3bn to help tackle the effects of climate change in the poorest countries.</p><p>Mr Trump has previously called global warming a hoax.</p><p>The president-elect has also threatened to pull the US out of the Paris accord - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35073297" class="story-body__link">a global agreement on curbing greenhouse gas emissions</a> - and America's commitment to the fund. </p><p>Mr Trump could decide to withhold the rest of the fund. </p><p>However, John Kirby, the State Department spokesman who announced the grant, said there was no "nefarious desire or intent" behind the timing.</p><p>"It's not being done to try to provoke a reaction from the incoming administration or to try to dictate to them one way or the other how they are going to deal with climate issues," Mr Kirby said.</p><p>"This is an investment that had been long planned."</p><p>Republican senators have previously stated their opposition to the fund, and called the payments a waste of money.</p><p>But Mr Trump's team <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-38640413" class="story-body__link">may not be taking such a hard line</a> on climate change as initially thought.</p><p>Last week Rex Tillerson, the former ExxonMobil chief and the president-elect's nominee for secretary of state, said he wants the US to keep "a seat at the table" regarding global warming.</p><p>"No one country is going to solve this alone," he said at his Senate confirmation hearing. </p>
