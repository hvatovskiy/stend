<p>The fighters say the footage proves that they can now deploy drones as an "addition to their sophisticated possessions of<span> advanced technologies".</span></p>
<p>The 23-minute-long video, which begins with a self-proclaimed suicide bomber speaking in front of an explosives-rigged Humvee, was released on Saturday and appears to be authentic, according to the Afghan defence ministry.</p>
<p>"The remote-controlled drones to capture footage of their [Taliban] fighters conducting attacks is nothing but to instill fear among people and to indicate how far they can get in defeating us, but in fact using a drone is not something they can call an achievement," Dawlat Waziri, spokesman for the defence ministry, told Al Jazeera by telephone.</p>
<p>"You can get a drone anywhere, in any shop. They found or bought one, and used it."</p>
<p>However, using camera drones near sensitive government sites was banned by the Afghan government in June.</p>
<p>In the video, the purported suicide bomber, dressed in a black turban and white tunic says: "I am telling the Afghan stooge forces to repent and join the Taliban or we will use this equipment the foreigners gave them, against them and they can't do anything about it."</p>
<p>A drone-mounted camera then films the Humvee speeding towards a compound and detonating in flames, blowing up the entire building.</p>
<p>"This proves that we are well ahead in sending our messages to the people of Afghanistan in many sophisticated ways. Anything that helps us in destroying our enemies [Afghan and US forces] will be used with full force," Zabiullah Mujahid, Taliban spokesman, told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p><span>"This video has proved to be very influential and we have many people supporting us."</span></p>
<p>Mujahid said the video was of an attack on October 3, when the fighters overran parts of Helmand province.</p>
<p>Reuters says a government official in Helmand also confirmed the attack in which the district police chief and several other officials were killed.</p>
<p>Helmand is strategically important for the Taliban as it is the main source of the country's opium output, worth an estimated $4bn a year, much of which funds the war.</p>
<p>Provincial officials say the Taliban now controls 85 percent of the province, while only a year ago the government controlled 80 percent.</p>
