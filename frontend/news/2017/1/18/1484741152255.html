<p>Rod Nordland was sent back to London, from where he had flown out, on a flight from the same airport on Tuesday, the report said.</p>
<p>There was no immediate statement from the Turkish authorities. Turkish officials contacted by Al Jazeera on Wednesday declined to comment or said that they did not have any information.</p>

<p>Dean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times, denounced the deportation as unjustified and an affront to press freedom, according to the newspaper. </p>
<p>It appeared to be the first time a New York Times correspondent had been denied entry to Turkey, David McCraw, the news organisation's vice president and deputy general counsel, said.</p>
<p>Various Turkish media reports said that Nordland was denied entry into Turkey for writing "pro-Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) articles" in the past.</p>
<p>Turkey's more than 30-year-old conflict with the PKK reignited in the summer of 2015 after a ceasefire declared a year and a half earlier faltered and peace talks between the two sides collapsed.</p>
<p>Many people, including leaders of Turkey's pro-Kurdish party, have been arrested in recent months for alleged links to the PKK, which is seen as a "terrorist organisation" by Turkey's Western allies.</p>
<p>Various foreign journalists have been detained in Turkey, mostly briefly, while covering stories on the Kurdish issue.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
