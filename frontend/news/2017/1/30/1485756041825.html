Investigations are ongoing.</p><p>The zoo was closed to visitors after the attack. State broadcaster CCTV said it remained closed on Monday.</p><p>The mauling took place at around 14:00 in full view of park visitors, some of whom posted video clips and pictures of the attack online.</p><p>The man, wearing a blue parka and black trousers, can be seen lying on the ground. A tiger appears to have its jaws around his neck and head while two other tigers circle around him.</p><p>Screams can be heard in the background as a crowd of onlookers gather in front of the enclosure, separated by a moat.</p><p>A series of loud explosive bangs can then be heard and the two tigers run off, while the first tiger continues to bite the man.</p><p>Zoo authorities said they used firecrackers to scare off the tigers in the enclosure, according to local reports.</p><p>They did not identify the man, but said he was middle-aged and that his wife and children were also at the park.</p><p>CCTV identified the man by his surname, Zhang.</p><p>It said that Mr Zhang, along with his wife and two children, were visiting the park on Sunday with his colleague, surnamed Li, and his wife.</p><p>The women and children had bought tickets and entered the park, but the two men decided to scale the zoo's 3m-tall (10ft) outer wall, said Mr Li who spoke to the broadcaster. </p><p>They then climbed another 3m-tall wall that was the boundary of the tiger enclosure.

Tigers are the carnivorous kings of the jungle and hunting for food is their instinct, who can you blame if you jump in and get attacked? Rest in peace, tiger," wrote one user on the microblogging network Weibo.</p><p>In July last year, tigers <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-36877836" class="story-body__link">mauled a woman and her mother </a>when they stepped out of their car at a Beijing drive-through wildlife park.</p>
