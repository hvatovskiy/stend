<p>Ronald dela Rosa, the director-general of the National Police, told reporters on Monday that he was disbanding anti-drugs units following a botched kidnap-for-ransom operation of a South Korean businessman.</p>

<p>Jee Ick-joo's body was found inside the grounds of the national police headquarters in October. His head was wrapped in packaging tape and he had been strangled.</p>
<p>"To all the rogue cops, beware! We no longer have a war on drugs," Dela Rosa said.</p>
<p>"We will cleanse our ranks ... then maybe after that, we can resume our war on drugs. The president told us to clean the organisation first.</p>
<p>"I don't know how long it will take to cleanse the PNP. But with each and every one of us cooperating, helping each other, maybe in a month, we can do it," he added.</p>
<p>The campaign, which also includes officers going from house to house in search of drug suspects, has claimed the lives of more than <a href="http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/rich-media/rodrigo-duterte-war-on-drugs-2016" target="_blank">6,000</a> <a href="http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/rich-media/rodrigo-duterte-war-on-drugs-2016" target="_blank">people</a>, according to a police report cited by the Manila-based news website Rappler.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera's Jamela Alindogan, reporting from the capital Manila, said the government and police force were sending conflicting messages.</p>
<p><span>On Sunday, President Rodrigo Duterte, who swept to power in May elections on a pledge to eradicate drugs, vowed to forge ahead with his war on drugs until the last day of his term.</span></p>
<p>"This is a complete turnaround from his election promise that he will be able to eliminate the presence of narcotics in his first six months of office," our correspondent said.</p>
<p>Senator Leila De Lima, Duterte's most outspoken critic, said the president and his police chief "should categorically give the order to end the killings".</p>
<p>The dismantling of the anti-drug units meant "they are aware that the very men involved in anti-drug operations ... are involved in illegal activities under the guise of the so-called war on drugs," she told ANC television.</p>
<p>Duterte's anti-drug campaign has caused alarm in the West, and rights groups accuse Duterte of turning a blind eye to a wave of alleged extrajudicial killings by police, mostly of low-level peddlers. Police deny this, claiming self-defence.</p>
