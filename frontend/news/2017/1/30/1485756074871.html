<p>May said the ban, which affects refugees, migrants, and visitors, was a "matter for the US" but later issued a statement that she disagreed with it.</p>
<p>The ban means a number of British citizens with dual nationality will not be allowed to enter the US, including Somalia-born <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MoFarahGold/" target="_blank"> Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah </a>and Iraqi-born MP Nadhim Zahawi, a member of May's Conservative Party.</p>
<p>Citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen are banned from entering the US, even if they hold permanent residency or valid visas.</p>

<p>Leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, said the government's lack of response was a "disgrace" and called for Donald Trump to be banned from the UK in response.</p>
<p>"[Trump] should not be welcomed to Britain while he abuses our shared values with shameful #MuslimBan and attacks on refugees and women." Corbyn wrote on his Twitter account.</p>
<p>"[May] would be failing the British people if she does not postpone the state visit and condemn Trump's actions in the clearest terms," he added. </p>

<p>The opposition leader called on Britons to sign a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/171928" target="_blank"> parliamentary petition demanding that Trump </a> be barred from the UK, which has picked up hundreds of thousands of signatures so far.</p>
<p>The response means parliament must consider debating a ban.</p>
<p>May met Trump at the White House on Friday, in a cordial meeting in which the pair held hands and promised stronger trade and security ties between their two countries.</p>
<p>The British prime minister used the meeting to invite Trump to visit the UK on a formal state visit.</p>
<p>Tim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, echoed calls for Trump to be banned, telling broadcaster Sky News that an invitation should <a href="https://twitter.com/RidgeOnSunday/status/825663128385904643" target="_blank"> "never have been made" </a> .</p>
<p>Senior Scottish National Party politician Alex Salmond said May's conduct was a <a href="https://twitter.com/RidgeOnSunday/status/825658332866162688" target="_blank"> "shameful moment of cowardice" </a> .</p>
<p>Despite stopping short of condemning May, Conservative MPs joined criticism of Trump's ban.</p>
<p>"President Trump's immigration and Syrian refugee ban is indefensible, unworkable and almost certainly unconstitutional," wrote Conservative MP James Cleverly on Twitter.</p>

<p>British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the country would defend the rights of British citizens abroad, in a tweet aimed at the US measures.</p>
<p>"We will protect the rights and freedoms of UK nationals home and abroad. Divisive and wrong to stigmatise because of nationality," he wrote.</p>
<p>Religious groups also condemned May's stance on Trump; the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said May should have used her time with the US president to remind him of the countries' shared values.</p>
<p>"In front of Mr Trump, the Prime Minister said that the point of the 'Special Relationship' was to have a frank dialogue. Well, this is one area where we need to be frank about where we stand," said Harun Khan, the MCB's secretary general. </p>

<p>Tal Ofer, of the Board of Deputies, the UK's leading Jewish organisation, said: "I wouldn't be surprised if the PM offered Trump her famous 'Go Home' vans" - a reference to May's deployment of trucks carrying banners telling migrants to leave the UK when she was home secretary.</p>
<h2>"TheresaTheAppeaser"</h2>
<p>Anger was also palpable on social media, with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheresaTheAppeaser?src=tren&data_id=tweet:825615756591128578" target="_blank"> TheresaTheAppeaser </a>trending in the UK, as well as several related hashtags.</p>
