<p>Five candidates are in the running to replace outgoing leader Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, the first female to lead the bloc of 54 states, who is not seeking a second term in office after completing her four-year stint.</p>
<p>Security in Addis Ababa, the seat of the AU, has been scaled up as dignitaries and diplomats lobbying for the candidates descend on the city.</p>
<p>Those seeking the top job in the world's second most populous continent are: Kenya's Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed, Abdoulaye Bathily, a Senegalese diplomat and academic, Chad's Foreign Minister Moussa Faki Mahamat, Botswana's Foreign Minister Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi, and Mba Mokuy, a former political adviser from the ex-Spanish colony of Equatorial Guinea.</p>

<p>The AU was supposed to pick a new leader in July last year but the election was postponed following three rounds of voting after candidates failed to garner the required number of votes. A candidate needs to secure at least a two-thirds majority, 36 votes, to be declared winner.</p>
<p>More than 50 percent of the member states abstained from the second round of voting last year.</p>
<p>The five hopefuls held a televised debate last month to try and persuade undecided countries how to vote and convince the public of their abilities.</p>
<p>The African leaders will also vote on whether to re-admit Morocco into the organisation.</p>
<p>Morocco, the only country on the continent which is not part of AU, applied to rejoin the bloc in July last year.</p>
<p>Rabat withdrew from the union in 1984 to protest against the admission of disputed Western Sahara territories.</p>
