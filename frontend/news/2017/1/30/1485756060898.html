<p><a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/" class="story-body__link-external">The Times</a> says the high-level conversations between Washington and Westminster yesterday to clarify how British citizens with dual nationality would be affected by the ban are the latest sign of the strength of transatlantic ties after Theresa May's meeting with President Trump.  </p><p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4169070/More-250-000-Brits-affected-Trump-ban.html" class="story-body__link-external">According to the Daily Mail,</a> ministers were told to pass on "forthright" demands for UK citizens to be exempted - and sources indicated that Mrs May had been prepared to ring Mr Trump personally if the US refused to give way.  The Mail describes what it calls the easing of the ban as a diplomatic breakthrough.</p><p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/29/donald-trumps-ban-refugees-us-president-insists-policy-not-against/" class="story-body__link-external">The Daily Telegraph</a> says the news that British citizens are exempted represents a significant boost for Mrs May after the row threatened to overshadow the success of her visit to the US.  </p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/29/theresa-may-feels-heat-over-travel-ban-as-donald-trump-stands-firm" class="story-body__link-external">The Guardian</a> says Boris Johnson is still expected to face questions in the Commons today - and will be pressed about why Britain took longer than other countries to receive assurances, and why Mrs May didn't condemn the policy in the same way as other European leaders.  <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/" class="story-body__link-external">The Daily Mirror</a> focuses on demands to cancel Mr Trump's planned State visit to Britain.  It has the headline: "You are not welcome here, Mr President".</p><p>A number of papers seize on the remarks of the former Minister for International Development, Grant Shapps, that Britain's spending on foreign aid is "out of control".  </p><p><a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/abolish-aid-ministry-says-man-who-ran-it-2tl3z0vfp" class="story-body__link-external">Writing in the Sunday Times</a>, he called for the Department for International Development to be abolished.  The Daily Express says it's a pity Mr Shapps didn't say this when he was in office.  The Telegraph supports his suggestion that the department should revert to being an arm of the Foreign Office.  Then - it says - we could be sure its work really was in Britain's national interest.  The Mail asks when the government will get the message and finally abandon what it calls its ludicrous pledge to shovel 0.7% of national income into this bottomless foreign pit when our own pensioners are denied vital social care.</p><p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4170170/In-2016-patients-mixed-sex-wards-soared-70.html" class="story-body__link-external">The Mail</a> and the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2735987/patients-on-mixed-sex-wards-trebles-as-crisis-hit-hospitals-run-out-of-beds/" class="story-body__link-external">Sun</a> report that the number of patients in England placed on mixed-sex wards has soared by seventy percent in a single year.  The Sun says ministers had vowed to end the practice in 2010 following a public outcry.  The Mail says it's true that NHS hospitals are under intense pressure for beds - but insists there's no excuse for denying patients the basic dignity of single-sex accommodation.</p><p>Finally, the papers salute Roger Federer for his 18th Grand Slam title - after beating Rafa Nadal at the Australian Open.  <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-4169714/Roger-Federer-unleashes-inner-pugilist-claim-18th-slam.html" class="story-body__link-external">For the Mail</a>, he's "simply the best". The Sun says he wrote the most astonishing chapter yet in one of the greatest sporting stories of all time.  </p>
