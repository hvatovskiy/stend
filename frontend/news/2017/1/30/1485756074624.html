<p>The incident took place early on Saturday when a truck carrying wedding guests swerved off the road and plunged into a river outside the town of Anjozorobe.</p>
<p>Police spokesperson Herilala Andrianatisaona told AFP news agency on Sunday that at least 22 people were also injured in the accident. </p>

<p><span>The police have blamed the driver for carrying too many passengers on a truck that is only meant to transport goods.</span></p>
<p>"According to our hypothesis, the truck driver, cognisant of the offence he was committing, which was transporting too many passengers in a vehicle meant for carrying goods, drove fast to escape traffic police checks," <span>Andrianatisaona said.</span></p>
<p>"The driver lost control of his vehicle after having negotiated a wrong turn and ended up in the Mananara river," he said.</p>
<p><span>The truck was reportedly transporting guests who were celebrating a wedding a day earlier.</span></p>
<p>The island nation off the southeast coast of Africa has a population of about 24 million people.</p>
