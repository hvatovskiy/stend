<p>An international team is working on a Â£2m project to develop versatile robots to help look after older people in care homes or sheltered accommodation.</p><p>The robots will offer support with everyday tasks, like taking tablets, as well as offering companionship.</p><p>Academics say they could alleviate pressures on care homes and hospitals.</p><p>Researchers from Middlesex University and the University of Bedfordshire will assist in building personal social robots, known as Pepper Robots, which can be pre-programmed to suit the person they are helping.</p><p>It is hoped culturally sensitive robots will be developed within three years. The programme is being funded by the EU and the Japanese government.</p><p>Prof Irena Papadopoulos, expert in trans-cultural nursing, said: "As people live longer, health systems are put under increasing pressure. </p><p>"In the UK alone, 15,000 people are over 100 years of age and this figure will only increase. </p><p>"Assistive, intelligent robots for older people could relieve pressures in hospitals and care homes as well as improving care delivery at home and promoting independent living for the elderly. </p><p>"It is not a question of replacing human support but enhancing and complementing existing care."</p><p>She added: "We are starting with care homes and with people who are semi-independent living in sheltered housing, but we do believe that in the future the robots would become acceptable for people to have in their own homes."</p><p>Pepper Robots are manufactured by Softbank Robotics and already used in thousands of homes in Japan.</p><p>Amit Humar Pandey, the company's chief scientist, said the firm wanted to create a world where robots co-exist with humans in harmony, for a smarter, healthier, safer and happier life.</p><p>It is hoped the new robots will help improve the well-being of their charges by providing entertainment and enabling them to connect better, through smart appliances, with family and the outside world.</p><p>They will communicate through speech and with gestures, be able to move independently and pick up signs the elderly person is unwell or in pain.</p><p>Similar robots are already being used in hospitals in Japan to perform tasks such as lifting patients and serving food</p><p>In the final year of the project, the robots will be tested at Advinia Healthcare care homes in the UK.</p><p>The company's executive chairman Dr Sanjeev Kanoria said it was keen to revolutionise the care of the elderly by supporting hard-working care staff. </p>
