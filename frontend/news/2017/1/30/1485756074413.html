<p>For almost six years, opposition armed groups in Syria have had two main objectives: seizing control of government territory and forcing President Bashar al-Assad to give up power.</p>
<p>Recently, rebel forces have suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Demoralised, weakened and forced from most areas they used to control, they've turned on each other.</p>
<p>Fighters from one of the main groups, Jabhat Fatah al-Sham opened fire on two other powerful factions Ahrar al-Sham and the Free Syrian Army.</p>
<p>The infighting is seen as strengthening forces loyal to the Syrian government.</p>
<p>Is it the beginning of the end for the opposition? And is the rivalry bringing President Assad closer to victory?</p>
