<p>Gunmen fired on about 40 people inside the Quebec City Islamic Cultural Center on Sunday at 8pm local time (01:00 GMT).</p>
<p>Police said two suspects had been arrested, adding there was nothing to suggest there were other attackers.</p>
<p><span>The mosque's president, Mohamed Yangui,</span> <span>was not inside the mosque at the time of the shooting. He received frantic calls from worshippers.</span></p>
<p><span>He said: <span>"Why is this happening here? This is barbaric."</span></span></p>
<p>Speaking to Al Jazeera by phone, he said: "One of the administrators called me and said there was a shooting at the mosque. I am still in shock. I ran to the mosque ... I was told that one attacker was arrested at the scene while another one was arrested nearby." </p>
<h2>'A terrorist attack on Muslims'</h2>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2017/01/29/statement-prime-minister-canada-fatal-shooting-city-quebec" target="_blank">condemned</a> the shooting as a "terrorist attack on Muslims in a centre of worship and refuge".</p>
<p>Philippe Couillard, premier of Quebec, said on Twitter that the attack "is a terrorist act", and called for "solidarity with Quebecers of the Muslim faith".</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Tonight, Canadians grieve for those killed in a cowardly attack on a mosque in Quebec City. My thoughts are with victims & their families.</p>

<p>The mosque leader <span>Yangui</span> added that the mosque had not received any threats immediately before the attack.</p>
<p>"The neighbourhood is very peaceful. We have a good relationship with the government, the mayor of Quebec. We have no problem whatsoever," he said.</p>
<p>The mosque was previously targeted in an Islamophobic attack, however. In June 2016 during Ramadan, a pig's head was left on the mosque's doorstep along with a note that said "bon appetit". Pork is forbidden in Islam.</p>

<p>Basem Boshra, managing editor of the Montreal Gazette, told Al Jazeera that the centre is the city's biggest mosque of six, with some 5,000 members.</p>
<p>"There's a pretty strong Muslim community in Quebec City," he said, adding that there were plans to lower flags at the national assembly as a mark of respect for the victims</p>
<p>Canada's public safety minister, Ralph Goodale, said on Twitter that he was "deeply saddened" by the loss of life and injuries.</p>
<p>Greg Fergus, an MP in Quebec, described on Twitter the attack as "a terrorist act - the result of years of demonizing Muslims".</p>
<p>The attack comes amid widespread protests across the US in defiance of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that bans immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
