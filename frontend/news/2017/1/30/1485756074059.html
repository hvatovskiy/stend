<p>Results on Sunday from 60 percent of polling stations showed Hamon winning 58.65 percent to 41.35 percent for Valls, Thomas Clay, <span>the head of the primary organising committee, said. </span></p>
<p>In a concession speech, Valls congratulated his opponent and wished him good luck in the presidential vote that will take place in April and May.</p>

<p>"Benoit Hamon won decisively," Valls said. "Benoit Hamon is henceforth the candidate of our political family."</p>
<p>Turnout in the vote was "much higher" on Sunday than during the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/france-socialists-cast-votes-presidential-hopeful-170122145859664.html"> first round </a> a week ago, when 1.6 million people cast ballots, Clay said.</p>
<h2>'Universal income'</h2>
<p>Hamon's victory is another upset in an election seen as highly unpredictable, with the 49-year-old former education minister viewed as an outsider only three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Hamon has pitched himself as a man of fresh ideas for the left, promising to bring in universal basic income - a state handout to all adults, irrespective of income - and new environmental protections.</p>
<p>The cost, according to Hamon, will be around 350bn euro ($374.82bn), roughly equivalent to the annual budget of Europe's second-biggest economy. An ambitious overhaul of taxes will be pursued to fund it, he says.</p>
<p>He also wants to levy taxes on robots, legalise cannabis, introduce stricter rules on chemical products and introduce a new corps of state inspectors to combat discrimination.</p>
<p>He won a first round of the primary last Sunday and picked up important endorsements from rivals this week.</p>
<p>Valls, prime minister under Hollande until December, lampooned his programme as unworkable and labelled him him a dreamer.</p>
<h2><span> Fillon's troubles </span></h2>
<p>Hamon's nomination completes the line-up of the main candidates in the upcoming two-round election, which pollsters forecast will confirm France's shift to the right after five years of unpopular Socialist rule.</p>
<p>The candidates include right-wing Republicans party frontrunner Francois Fillon, far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, as well as centrist Emmanuel Macron, who some analysts see as likely to benefit from the Socialists' tilt left.</p>

<p>Fillon, who was also a long shot until he clinched the Republicans nomination in November, has consistently been tipped to become France's next leader.</p>
<p>But his campaign has been in turmoil since last Wednesday when a newspaper reported his wife had been paid around 500,000 euro ($540,000) over eight years for a suspected fake job as a parliamentary aide.</p>
<p>Those allegations have sparked a preliminary judicial inquiry, but there was more bad news for Fillon on Sunday.</p>
<p>Investigative website, Mediapart, and the Journal du Dimanche newspaper reported Fillon had used his parliamentary allowance to pocket up to 25,000 euro ($26,800) while working as a senator.</p>
<p>In a defiant speech on Sunday in front of thousands of supporters in Paris, Fillon said he would not let himself be "intimidated".</p>
<p>"It's more than me as a person that is in the crosshairs, it's a higher idea of France that they want to take down mid-flight," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
