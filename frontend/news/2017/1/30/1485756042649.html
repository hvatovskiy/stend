<p>The company said it "regretfully decided to make way for a new sponsor" in order to work on new global projects.</p><p>Baileys will still sponsor this year's award but the prize will search for a new commercial partner from 2018.</p><p>Syl Saller, chief marketing officer at Diageo, which owns Baileys, said: "It has been an honour to champion the very best fiction written by women."</p><p>She added the company would now look to increase its promotional activities "across both English and non-English speaking markets".</p><p>"We look forward to making 2017 an exceptional year. Baileys will remain a staunch advocate for the prize," Saller said.</p><p>Author Kate Mosse, the co-founder of the prize, told the BBC's arts correspondent Rebecca Jones: "Baileys has done a year more than they were supposed to do, which has been terrific, and it's been a brilliant partnership.</p><p>"But their marketing focus is changing. Although they are still very committed to women's voices, they are looking more to markets which are non-English language speaking, and the one thing we can't do anything about is this being a prize that celebrates writing in English."</p><p>"We feel very confident about attracting a new sponsor," she added.</p><p>"We know that brands want to be associated with something that's inspirational... and we know customers like to be involved with companies that have some sort of social purpose.</p><p>"If there is a brilliant brand fit between the sponsoring organisation and the arts organisation, then it's a match made in heaven."</p><p>This year's shortlist will be unveiled in April, with the winner announced in June. </p>
