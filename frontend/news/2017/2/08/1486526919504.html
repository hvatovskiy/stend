<p>Eddie Jones' side will arrive in Cardiff seeking a 16th successive win, three away from a world record.</p><p>The All Blacks and South Africa share the tier-one nations' 18-match winning run record.</p><p>"England are deservedly tagged as the best team in the northern hemisphere," said Warburton.</p><p>"It's a fair judgement to compare them to the All Blacks right now - that's how good they are.</p><p>"It is going to take a huge game out of us to get a win, and it will be one of the biggest games of the championship for sure."</p><p>Warburton also explained the reasons he believes fire up every opponent England meet in the Six Nations.</p><p>The ex-Wales captain insists it is down to England's recent successful record.</p><p>"Chatting to [different countries'] players, that's how they feel, they really prioritise that and everyone just wants to beat England," he said.</p><p>"That's due to the success in the past and the success they're going through now. It's always a big scalp."</p><p>International rugby began with Scotland and England meeting in 1879.</p><p>Four years later the Home Nations tournament began with Wales and Ireland taking on England and Scotland.</p><p>Since then, the Celtic nations have traditionally revelled in their rivalries with England.</p><p>England are unbeaten under Jones, who succeeded Stuart Lancaster after their group-stage exit from the 2015 World Cup.</p><p>Wales contributed to England's downfall in the tournament they hosted with a win at Twickenham, but lost twice to them in 2016.</p><p>"If you're Wales, the biggest game you play in in the Six Nations is England," said Warburton.</p><p>"If you're Scotland, it's England. If you're Ireland, it's England. Or if you're France or Italy, it's England," said Warburton, whose father was born in England.</p><p>"We know as players that's the one game the fans look forward to most and you sense that in the build-up. It's a huge occasion for everyone in Wales.</p><p>"But for me, I always cherish any win against any opposition in the Six Nations and in the last three years [since Wales' 2013 title win] I've realised how difficult it is to win a championship."</p><p>Cardiff Blues' Warburton predicts selection headaches if Bath number eight <a href="/sport/rugby-union/38796370">Taulupe Faletau has recovered from a knee injury</a> for Saturday's match.</p><p>Gloucester's Ross Moriarty played at eight <a href="/sport/rugby-union/38850890">in the opening victory in Italy</a> and could rival Warburton for the blind-side flanker's role if Faletau is risked for a starting place.</p><p>"The back-row competition is so fierce at the minute, I don't want to put pressure on him, but Toby [Faletau], when he's playing well, is one of the best players in the world. I think he's fantastic," Warburton added.</p>
