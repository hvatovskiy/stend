<p>Ismail Kawasi, the public health ministry spokesman, said 41 people were also wounded in Tuesday's explosion, which hit near a side door used for court employees to leave the building at the end of the work day.</p>
<p><span>The attacker was on foot and detonated his suicide vest packed with explosives near the employees and other people as they were coming out of the main court building, </span><span>Najib Danish, deputy spokesman for the interior ministry, told the Associated Press news agency</span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="ReadMoreContentSeparator"><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2017/02/afghanistan-civilian-casualties-170206102211147.html" target="_self"> INTERACTIVE: Afghanistan civilian casualties reaches record high </a></p>
<p>No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but Taliban fighters have attacked the top court and its employees in the past, as well as court buildings in the other provinces.</p>
<p>"This is not the first attack that targeted Afghan justice system," Al Jazeera's Qais Azimy, reporting from Kabul, said.</p>
<p>"In fact the exact location, the car park of the supreme court, was targeted before in June 2013 by a suicide bomber, which killed 17 people."</p>
<p>"That's why this part of the compound is heavily guarded and the employees of this court know that they are targets for Taliban," Azimy said.</p>
<p>The armed group has repeatedly issued statements threatening to target employees at Afghanistan's justice system "because they are not happy with the way they are working", our correspondent added.</p>
<h2>Farah bombing</h2>
<p>The Kabul bombing came hours after a roadside bombing killed the top government official of a district in western Farah province.</p>
<p>Taliban spokesman Qari Yusouf Ahmadi said the group claimed responsibility for that attack.</p>
<p>A Farah police spokesman, Iqbal Baher, told AP that Abdul Khaliq, the top official in the Khak-e-Safed district, was on his way home from the mosque when the explosion took place in the city of Farah, the provincial capital.</p>
<p>Taliban fighters frequently use roadside bombs and suicide attacks to target government officials as well as Afghan security forces across the country.</p>
