<p>The term "unicorn" is used to describe start-ups that have grown from nothing to be worth at least a billion dollars. </p><p>It's tough enough for start-ups to make any money, but to go from an idea sketched on an envelope to making a billion is uber-unusual.</p><p>And Uber is one of these tech-powered unicorns.</p><p>But what is their natural habitat? Where are these unicorns likely to have been trained?</p><p>In terms of their universities, there doesn't seem to be any romantic fairytale beginning for would-be unicorns.</p><p>They are not self-taught entrepreneurs, but are more likely to have gone to expensive and highly-selective institutes. </p><p>A league table, drawn up by international accountancy software firm Sage, shows that members of this financial elite are likely to have had an elite education.</p><p>The top of the table by some distance is Stanford University in California, an institution that has been integral to the growth of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Builders of "knowledge hubs" or "tech hubs" around the world have sought to replicate Silicon Valley's mixture of academic research, business innovation and supportive investors.</p><p>And this unicorn league shows Stanford accelerating quickly in this competition for successful start-ups.</p><p>Harvard, the world's wealthiest university, is in second place, with US institutions taking nine of the top 15 places, with many of these entries dominated by tech start-ups.</p><p>The first non-US university is in fourth place with a combined figure for all the Indian Institutes of Technology.</p><p>This network of 23 institutions across India has a notoriously competitive entrance exam - often claimed to be the most oversubscribed applications process in the world.</p><p>The UK's entry in this unicorn league is Oxford University in seventh place. Although the London School of Economics also features in the following pack, just outside the top 15.</p><p>France, Israel, Germany and Canada all make a single appearance in the rankings. In Canada, there is a sub-species of unicorns, referred to as "narwhals" (whales, sometimes referred to as the unicorns of the sea).</p><p>So why are these unicorns concentrated in these universities?</p><p>Prof Frank Furedi, author and social commentator, said that on visits to top US universities he had been struck by the self-confidence of such young student entrepreneurs.</p><p>"There is a sense of enormous possibilities... everything in that culture reinforces that," he says.</p><p>These universities provide networks of like-minded, ambitious, competitive youngsters, who expect to have online start-ups that can accelerate much more quickly than traditional businesses.</p><p>He says that often these young entrepreneurs might be at old and prestigious universities, but they are often from immigrant families. </p><p>If these new billionaires are clustered in a narrow pool of universities, the gender breakdown is even less inclusive - with men accounting for 94% of the unicorns. </p><p>A third of these unicorns were solo entrepreneurs - while the other two-thirds were co-founders.</p><p>Perhaps what's more surprising is that for 60% of the unicorns, this was their first business. And for a further 23% it was their second - suggesting that for a considerable majority there was no back-story of failure.</p><p>And the most typical time for reaching unicorn status was four years after founding - although there were firms that took up to 30 years to turn into a billion-dollar shaped unicorn.</p><p>The number of unicorns rose sharply in the years after 2012 and peaked in 2015, before slipping down again in 2016.</p><p>Of course, as well as admiring the unicorns from a distance - there will be people wondering how they can get on board themselves. </p><p>Where would you find a unicorn? </p><p>Stanford's own business school has published advice saying that if you're looking for the next unicorn, "look for the horse running away from the herd".</p><p>They suggest that it's better not to look in the "rear-view mirror" for previous successes, but to look towards the so-far unknown.</p><p>But the evidence of this league table suggests that unicorns are not going to be found wandering around anything resembling traditional manufacture.</p><p>By far the biggest sector for unicorns is under the heading of "consumer internet", followed by financial services and e-commerce.</p><p>This financial alchemy is heavily driven by the online economy. Cloud computing seems to have a silver lining.</p>
