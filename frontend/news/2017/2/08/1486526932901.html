<p><span> The 48-year-old banana exporter, who has never held political office, </span> <span> took the oath of office on Tuesday in a ceremony in the capital, Port-au-Prince. </span></p>
<p><span> The handpicked candidate of Haiti's former president, Michel Martelly, Moise initially won the first round of voting in October 2015 - but the results were subsequently annulled amid allegations of massive fraud. </span></p>
<p>The elections were further postponed in October after <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/horrors-left-hurricane-matthew-clear-haiti-161008094813244.html"> Hurricane Matthew </a> battered the country, killing hundreds and causing extensive damage.</p>
<p>Moise won a November election redo with 55 percent, vowing to stimulate the economy and create more jobs. </p>
<p>Yet, his critics claimed he did not gain a mandate because only 21 percent of voters went to the polls. </p>

<p>The new president begins his five years in power with an already fragile popularity, since he is at the centre of an unresolved money laundering probe.</p>

<p>Haiti's Central Unit of Financial Intelligence alleges that Moise laundered $5m through suspicious money transfers - charges he denies.</p>
<p>Haiti has been dependant on international aid since a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/03/haiti-earthquake-start-canaan-survivors-160308083308750.html"> powerful earthquake </a> devastated it in January 2010. Its serious economic problems have been compounded by political instability, violence and corruption.</p>
<p>According to the UN World Food Programme, two and half million Haitians live in poverty.</p>

<p>Despite the challenges Moise faces as the poor Caribbean country's new president, some Haitians are willing to give him a chance.</p>
<p>"We have to wait and see what is going to happen. Previous governments came and made promises but nothing happened," Desilien Simedieu, a community leader at the Carradeux camp, where most people live on less than $3 per day, told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>"The only thing we can do is wait."</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
