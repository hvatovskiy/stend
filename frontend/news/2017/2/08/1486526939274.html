<p>Some five weeks before key elections in The Netherlands, Wilders on Monday posted the fake picture of D66 leader Alexander Pechtold supposedly at a rally with Muslims holding up signs reading: "Islam will conquer Europe" and "Shariah for The Netherlands", referring to Islamic law. <br> <br> Wilders' anti-Islam and anti-immigrant platform has helped propel his Freedom Party (PVV) to the top of the opinion polls in recent months in advance of the March 15 vote. <br> <br> In his tweet, he accused Pechtold, who heads the pro-European, social-liberal D66 party of "demonstrating with Hamas terrorists".</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="nl">D66 wil Amsterdam afsplitsen als de verkiezingsuitslag tegenvalt.<br><br>Pechtold demonstreert met Hamas-terroristen.<br><br>Is dit de volgende stap? <a href="https://t.co/U07jHfQmyh" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/U07jHfQmyh</a></p>
— Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) <a href="https://twitter.com/geertwilderspvv/status/828502461421850624" target="_blank">February 6, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>D66 is one of 28 parties contesting the election and is currently trailing fifth in the polls.</p>
<p>Wilders' taunt prompted an angry reaction from Pechtold.</p>
<p>"Usually, I laugh at Photoshopped pictures on the internet. But not this time," he wrote on his Facebook page.</p>
<p>"Not because I can't stand up for myself ... but because it gives people false impressions."</p>

<p><span>Last year, Pechtold sued a PVV supporter over photos that sparked death threats against him.</span></p>
<p>"In these times of fake news and alternative facts, we can't just ignore the consequences that such a fake image can have," he said.</p>
<p>"I draw the line today."</p>
<p><span>The AFP news agency reported that o</span>ther politicians also sided with Pechtold. Jesse Klaver, leader of GroenLinks (Green Left), called Wilders' Tweet "low and irresponsible".</p>
<p>"Those who tweet fake news about others, tarnish their own credibility."</p>

<p>Deputy Prime Minister Lodewijk Asscher, leader of the Labour party, simply retweeted Wilders tweet with the message "delete your account".</p>
<p>But Wilders hit back against Pechtold on Twitter, saying: "Stop complaining, drama queen. You have demonstrated standing among Palestinian flags, with friends of Hamas. #hypocrite".</p>
<p>The vote in The Netherlands will kick off a year of elections in Europe with ballots also due in France and Germany. They will be closely watched amid the rise of populist and far-right parties on the continent.</p>
