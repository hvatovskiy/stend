<p><span>The attack occurred in the port city of Bosasso early on Wednesday, Yusuf Mohamed, the governor of Bari region, told Reuters news agency. </span></p>
<p><span>"Three al-Shabab fighters stormed the International Village Hotel this morning. Four guards and two of the attackers died in the fighting," he said.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The hotel is popular with foreigners.</span></span></p>
<p><span>"Fortunately the attackers did not enter the rooms. The fighting took place inside the compound. A third fighter escaped and we are pursuing him. All the people in the hotel are safe."</span></p>
<p><span><span>Attacks are not common in the northern parts of Somalia, unlike in the south where al-Shabab is waging a deadly war against the Somali government and the African Union forces bolstering it.</span></span></p>
<p>Until 2011, the al-Qaeda-linked group controlled most of Somalia including the capital, Mogadishu.</p>
<p>In the past two years, African Union and Somali government forces have forced al-Shabab out of important urban strongholds, but it remains active from bases in rural areas.</p>
<p>Fighters often stage bomb and gun attacks in the capital and other regions in their quest to overthrow the Western-backed government and impose their own strict interpretation of Islamic law on the nation.</p>
<p>Somalia's lawmakers are due to elect a president later on Wednesday in Mogadishu.</p>
<p>Fears of attacks have limited the election to the country's legislators, who will vote at a heavily guarded former air force base in the capital. Rounds of voting are expected to narrow down the 22 candidates to a winner.</p>
<p><span>The Horn of Africa nation is trying to put together its first fully functioning central government in a quarter-century. Years of warlord-led conflict and al-Shabab attacks, along with famine, have left the country of about 12 million people largely shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span>Â <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Reuters news agency</span></p>
