<p>With his moving arms and blinking eyes, this incredibly realistic mechanical human is a bewildering - if not unsettling - sight.</p>
<p>And that's one of the goals of the museum's new show looking at 500 years of humanoid robots: to chart their evolution and explore our reaction towards them throughout history.</p>
<p>"Robots trouble us," curator Ben Russell tells Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>"When you see a robot you're reading a lot into it as a human. If they are very life-like you don't really know what is the source of their being," he continues.</p>
<p>"It troubles us but it fascinates us at well."</p>

<p><span>With more than 100 creations on display, the exhibition is the most significant collection of humanoid robots ever shown, according to the Science Museum in the UK capital.</span></p>
<p>Among the highlights are a 16th century automaton monk designed to pray - the oldest object in the show - and a silver swan, built in 1773 by a Belgian clockmaker who also invented roller skates.</p>
<p>Others, like the loom, which brought industrialised weaving to the 19th century put thousands out of work, enable guests to discover the social and technological context of robots - just as many jobs in modern factories have been replaced by machines </p>
<p>"Five hundred years of history makes you realise that there has always been uneasiness around robots," Al Jazeera's Jessica Baldwin, reporting from the show, said.</p>
<p>"Today's fear about driverless cars or mechanical nurses are nothing new."</p>
<p>The exhibition runs until September 3.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera News</span></p>
