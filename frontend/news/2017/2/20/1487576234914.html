<p><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/haider-al-abadi.html">Haider al-Abadi</a>, the Iraqi prime minister, made the announcement during his appearance in Munich for an international security conference.</p>
<p>Just a month ago, Iraqi troops <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/haider-al-abadi-east-mosul-fully-liberated-isil-170124181328309.html">took control</a> of the eastern side of Mosul, the last ISIL stronghold in Iraq.</p>
<p>The government forces are expected to target the city's airport first during this new phase.</p>
<p>It is located at the southern edge, to the west of the Tigris River, which divides the city.</p>
<p>Western Mosul is where the old city centre is located.</p>
<p>Commanders say the battle may prove to be more difficult than in the east, because tanks and armoured vehicles cannot pass through its narrow streets.</p>
<p>Fighters of ISIL, also known as ISIS, have also developed a network of passageways and tunnels that could aid their defence.</p>
<p>How challenging will the offensive be? And what will it take to regain full control of Mosul?</p>
