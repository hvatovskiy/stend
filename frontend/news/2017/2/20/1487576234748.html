<p>Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, on Sunday described Iran as the main sponsor of global "terrorism" and a destabilising force in the<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/middleeast.html"> Middle East</a>.</p>
<p>"Iran remains the single main sponsor of terrorism in the world," he told delegates at the conference.</p>
<p>"It's determined to upend the order in the Middle East ... [and] until and unless Iran changes its behaviour, it would be very difficult to deal with a country like this."</p>
<p><span>The international community needed to set clear "red lines" to halt Iran's actions, Jubeir said, calling for banking, travel and trade restrictions aimed at changing Iran's behaviour.</span></p>

<p>For his part, Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli defence minister, said Iran's ultimate objective was to undermine Saudi Arabia and called for a dialogue between <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/israel.html">Israel</a> and Arab countries to defeat "radical" elements in the region.</p>
<p>"The real division is not Jews, Muslims ... but moderate people versus radical people," he told the Munich conference delegates on Sunday.</p>
<p>Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, also criticised what he called Iran's "sectarian policy" aimed at undermining <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/bahrain.html">Bahrain</a> and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>"<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/turkey.html">Turkey</a> is very much against any kind of division, religious or sectarian," he said.</p>
<h2><strong>'Brothers in Islam'</strong></h2>
<p>The comments followed an appeal from Mohammad Javad Zarif, <span>Iranian foreign minister,</span> for Arab Gulf states to work with his country to reduce violence across the region.</p>
<p>"We have enough problems in this region so we want to start a dialogue with countries we call brothers in <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/islam.html">Islam</a>," he said.</p>
<p>Zarif dismissed any suggestions his country would ever seek to develop <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/nuclear-weapons.html">nuclear weapons</a>.</p>

<p>When asked about the new US administration's <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/iran-confirms-missile-test-170201140047568.html">tough rhetoric</a> on Iran's role in the region and calls to review the nuclear deal, he said Iran did not respond well to threats or sanctions.</p>
<p>US Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said he and other senators were preparing legislation to further sanction Iran for violating UN <span>Security Council</span> resolutions with its <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/slaps-sanctions-iran-missile-test-170203154253182.html">missile development programme</a> and other actions.</p>
<p>"It is now time for the Congress to take Iran on directly in terms of what they've done outside the nuclear programme," he said.</p>
<h2>'Emerging proxy war'</h2>
<p>Senator Christopher Murphy, a Democrat and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the US needed to decide whether to take a broader role in the regional conflict.</p>
<p>"We have to make a decision whether we are going to get involved in the emerging proxy war in a bigger way than we are today, between Iran and Saudi Arabia," he said.</p>
<p>International sanctions on Iran were lifted a year ago under a nuclear <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/02/trump-interest-iran-deal-alive-170212080547204.html">deal with world powers</a>.</p>
<p>However, Republican senators said at the conference they would press for <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/02/trump-iran-scenarios-escalation-170209092314262.html">new US measures</a> over the missiles issue and what they called Iran's actions to "destabilise" the Middle East.</p>
