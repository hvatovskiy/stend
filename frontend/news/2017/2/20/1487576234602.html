<p>During a rally in Florida on Saturday, Trump tried to justify his <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/trump-vows-introduce-overhauled-travel-ban-170217035418856.html">proposals to stop immigration</a> from several majority-Muslim states.</p>
<p>"We've got to keep our country safe," the US leader said.</p>
<p>"You look at what's happening last night in Sweden ... Sweden ... who would believe this? Sweden, they took in large numbers, they never thought possible."</p>

<p>He then went on to list attacks that took place in the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeraworld/2017/01/isil-brussels-170124140517438.html">Belgian capital Brussels</a>, as well as the French cities of Paris and <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/france-truck-plows-crowd-nice-bastille-day-160714214536526.html">Nice</a>.</p>
<p>Hundreds of social media users turned to Swedish newspapers and the country's official Twitter accounts to check whether an attack had taken place on Friday in the Scandinavian nation.</p>
<p>The <a class="InternalLink" href="https://twitter.com/sweden" target="_blank"> @Sweden</a> account, which is run by a different Swede each week, quickly refuted the claim. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

<p>"There has been no terror attack at all. None," said Emma, a librarian running the account for the week.</p>
<p>With confirmation that nothing happened, a torrent of tweets condemned Trump and mocked him for seemingly fabricating the incident. </p>

<p>That list included technical problems at a concert by an 87-year-old singer and an avalanche warning issued by the country's Met office.</p>
<p>A tweet by<a class="InternalLink" href="https://twitter.com/carlbildt/status/833219648044855296" target="_blank"> Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister - </a>"Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound" - was retweeted more than 11,000 times.</p>
<p>The claim is the third such remark by Trump and his senior officials referring to attacks that did not happen.</p>

<p>Before that, key adviser to Trump, Kellyanne Conway, said the news media had failed to cover an <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/trump-aide-mocked-bowling-green-massacre-lie-170203150255194.html">attack in the town Bowling Green, Kentucky</a>, which she said was carried out by Iraqi refugees.</p>
<p>No such attack took place and Conway later apologised for the comments.</p>
