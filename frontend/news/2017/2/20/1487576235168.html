    <div class=""><p>Armed groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and others have often targeted shrines for not conforming to their strict, literalistic interpretation of Islam.</p>
<p>On February 16, 2017, at least 88 people were killed when a suicide attacker targeted a famous Sufi shrine in Sehwan.</p>
<p>That attack at the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) also injured at least 250 people.</p>

<p>In November <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/dozens-casualties-attack-pakistan-shrine-161112141000715.html">ISIL also known as ISIS, claimed responsibility for a suicide attack</a> on a shrine in a  Balochistan town, killing at least 52 people.</p>
<p>"An attack on one of us, is an attack on all," Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's prime minister, said following the blast in Sehwan.</p>
<p>"The attack on the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar represents an attack on the progressive, inclusive future of Pakistan; one where every man, woman and child is entitled to life, liberty and property in the pursuit of happiness no matter what their religion."</p>
