<p>After 10 years in power and three election wins, President Correa will not be running again, so change at the top is inevitable. </p><p>When he was first elected in 2007, Mr Correa was one of a group of left-wing leaders in power in Latin America, including Argentina's Nestor Kirchner, Bolivia's Evo Morales, Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Cuba's Raul Castro, Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. </p><p>Some observers spoke of a "pink tide" sweeping across the continent.</p><p>A decade on, Argentina and Brazil are led by conservative presidents, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro faces a hostile legislative and Evo Morales is on his last term after Bolivians rejected a proposal to change the constitution to allow him to run again. </p><p>Will Ecuadoreans follow the lead of Argentines and Peruvians and turn their backs on left-wing politics and favour a conservative candidate? </p><p>Or will they favour the man who served as Mr Correa's vice-president?</p><p>With Mr Correa not running again, his governing leftist Alianza PAIS (Country Alliance) party threw its weight behind former vice-president Lenin Moreno.</p><p>Despite having been a key figure in Mr Correa's cabinet between 2007-2013, Mr Moreno has sought to differentiate himself from the outgoing leader.</p><p>Challenged when he disagreed with the president about tax policies, Mr Moreno simply stated: "The President has the right to think differently. Each one decides in his own government."</p><p>Observers say the 63-year-old's style is less confrontational than that of Mr Correa and they suspect Mr Moreno may try to jettison some aspects of his predecessor's socialist policies.</p><p>As vice-president, Mr Moreno, who became paraplegic after being shot in the back in 1998, set out to improve the rights of people with disabilities.</p><p>Not only did he give motivational talks, he also published books on humour and happiness with titles proclaiming: "Being Happy is Easy and Fun".</p><p>Most recently, he served as UN Special Envoy on Disability and Accessibility.</p><p>Among his main campaign promises are increasing employment opportunities and ensuring that all Ecuadoreans have the chance to go on to higher education.</p><p>Most polls suggest Mr Moreno is likely to get a majority of the votes on 19 February, but not the 40% needed to win outright in the first round.</p><p>His main rival is centre-right businessman and former presidential candidate Guillermo Lasso.</p><p>The 61-year-old is running for the Creando Oportunidades (Creating Opportunities) party. </p><p>A banker, Mr Lasso wants to create jobs by promoting foreign investment and has promised to cut taxes for big companies. </p><p>He also has plans to make Ecuador's central bank independent of the government.  The youngest of 11 children, he says he wants to "create an Ecuador with opportunities for all".</p><p>Hot on his heels in the polls is Christian-Socialist candidate Cynthia Viteri.</p><p>The 51-year-old lawyer has also pledged to cut taxes to promote job creation. She wants to slash government spending by at least $700m (Â£560m) on existing programmes she calls "luxuries".</p><p>If whoever wins the first round on 19 February does not get 40% or more of the vote, a run-off will be held on 2 April.</p><p>The eventual winner of the election will be sworn in to a four-year term in May.</p><p>Economic recovery is likely to be a top priority for Ecuador. The oil-exporting country has suffered from a drop in international oil prices and has seen its GDP contract 1.7% in 2016.</p><p>Corruption is another major problem with officials from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht recently revealing that they paid close to $35.5m in bribes to Ecuadorean officials in exchange for contracts.</p><p>Officials of Mr Correa's government, including his former energy minister Jorge Pareja, are also under investigation over the granting of contracts by state-owned oil company Petroecuador.</p><p>In foreign policy, the new president will have to deal with US President Donald Trump and his potentially more protectionist economic policies. </p><p>He or she will also have to adapt to a shift of alliances in the region, following the departure from power of left-wing governments in Argentina, Brazil and Peru over the last two years.</p><p>Rafael Correa was elected in 2007 on a promise of bringing radical social and political reforms to Ecuador.</p><p>During his tenure, Mr Correa increased government spending on social programmes and looked to diversify Ecuador's trade and political relationships.</p><p>He forged close ties with the left-wing regional group Alba, which includes Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela among others.</p><p>He also moved Ecuador much closer economically to China, which is now one of the country's major creditors and trade partners.</p><p>Mr Correa has been credited with reducing poverty until 2014, when the oil price slump hit government revenue and its ability to finance poverty reduction programmes.</p><p>But recent corruption scandals and Mr Correa's frequent clashes with the media have produced some disillusionment. </p><p>One poll suggests 70% of Ecuadoreans want "important changes" to be made. </p><p>Voting is mandatory and more than 12 million people are entitled to vote for the president, the vice-president and also 137 seats in the legislature.</p>
