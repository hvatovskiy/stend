<p>The seven-part series, to be shown later this year, is intended to highlight recent scientific discoveries.</p><p>Filming innovations include suction cameras fitted to the backs of orcas.</p><p>"I am truly thrilled to be joining this new exploration of the underwater worlds which cover most of our planet, yet are still its least known," Sir David said.</p><p>The BBC's Natural History Unit spent four years filming off every continent and in every ocean for Blue Planet II, with support from marine scientists.</p><p>James Honeyborne, the series' executive producer, said: "The oceans are the most exciting place to be right now, because new scientific discoveries have given us a new perspective of life beneath the waves.</p><p>"Blue Planet II is taking its cue from these breakthroughs, unveiling unbelievable new places, extraordinary new behaviours and remarkable new creatures. Showing a contemporary portrait of marine life, it will provide a timely reminder that this is a critical moment for the health of the world's oceans."</p><p>Among the recent discoveries caught on camera are a tuskfish that uses tools and a new species of crab with a hairy chest - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-33263621" class="story-body__link">nicknamed the "Hoff crab"</a> after Baywatch star David Hasselhoff.</p><p>The Natural History Unit's new filming techniques include "tow cams" that can capture predatory fish and dolphins head-on, suction cams which attach to the back of whale sharks and orcas for a creature's-eye view, and a probe camera that can record miniature marine life.</p><p>The BBC said the crew caught unusual examples of marine behaviour on camera, such as a coral grouper and reef octopus with sophisticated hunting techniques, a giant trevally fish that catches birds in flight, and a dive with a sperm whale mother and her calf.</p><p>It said the series would also explore new landscapes from methane volcanoes erupting in the Gulf of Mexico to the Antarctic deep at 1,000m, filmed using manned submersibles.</p>
