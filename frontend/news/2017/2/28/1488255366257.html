<p>The British pair entered through separate corridors at a Liverpool hotel on Monday and were divided by security for the traditional pre-fight face-off.</p><p>Bellew, 34, called Haye "a broken man", as they repeatedly exchanged insults.</p><p>Haye, 36, threw a punch at Bellew at a November media gathering and had warned they <a href="/sport/boxing/39060324">would need a barrier</a> between them.</p><p>WBC cruiserweight champion Bellew will fight at heavyweight for the first time, completing a two-division jump after competing at light-heavyweight as recently as 2013.</p><p>Former WBA heavyweight champion Haye has had two routine wins since returning from over three years out of the sport.</p><p>The London fighter seemed frustrated as fans in attendance drowned out his comments with songs on Monday - and he responded by insulting those in the crowd and said Liverpudlian Bellew would "need all the support he can get".</p><p>An agitated Haye told the crowd: "Deep in all of your tiny minds you know this guy is getting drilled to the canvas pretty fast."</p><p>Bellew said: "I am going in with a man who was absolutely fantastic. When he was in his prime, an immense athlete - but the tank is very, very low and it does not last very long.</p><p>"When the gas runs out, the big fat Scouser is going to steam through him."</p><p>However, Haye's trainer, Shane McGuigan, predicted WBC cruiserweight champion Bellew would be "cannon fodder".</p><p>Haye's wins since returning - both inside two rounds - prompted Dave Coldwell, Bellew's trainer, to question if the shoulder surgery he had in 2013 could hamper him in a longer contest.</p><p>"When you've had major surgery as an athlete, you are never the same man, you have doubts in your mind," said Coldwell, who once worked for Hayemaker promotions.</p><p>"Your surgeon advised you to retire, you come back but you don't know how you will perform on the night."</p><p>Addressing his opponent, Bellew added: "I've seen people have the operations you have had. Reconstructive shoulder surgery is a big thing, your right hand becomes a looping right hand."</p>
