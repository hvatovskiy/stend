<p><span> The eponymously titled White Helmets, a 40-minute Netflix film, gives a window into the lives of the group's volunteers as they scramble to pull people from the rubble of buildings flattened in bombing raids.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Accepting the Academy Award, director Orlando von Einsiedel urged the audience to get out of their seats and call for an end to Syria's </span><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/syria.html">six-year civil war </a><span>, which led to a standing ovation.</span></span></p>
<p>Von Einsiedel read a statement from White Helmets founder Raed al-Saleh in which he thanked the academy and said the group had saved tens of thousands of lives since it was formed in 2014.</p>
<p>"We are so grateful that this film has highlighted our work to the world. Our organisation is guided by a verse from the Quran: To save one life is to save all of humanity," Saleh's statement said.</p>

<p>"We have saved more than 82,000 Syrian lives. I invite anyone here who hears me to work on the side of life to stop the bloodshed in Syria and around the world."</p>
<p>Rescue workers in Syria are at risk of being killed in so-called double tap air raids that target them as they arrive at the scene of a strike. The group says that many of its volunteers have been killed.</p>
<p>Syrian cinematographer Khaled Khatib, who worked on the documentary, was unable to attend after being <a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/syrian-white-helmets-cinematographer-barred-170225050444985.html">barred from entering  </a>the US despite being granted a visa.</p>
<p>US officials reportedly discovered "derogatory information" about him, according to a document seen by the Associated Press news agency.</p>
<p>The incident happened after US President Donald Trump's now halted <a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/trump-vows-introduce-overhauled-travel-ban-170217035418856.html"> temporary travel ban </a>  that targeted seven Muslim-majority countries, including Syria.</p>
<h2>Iranian win after protest</h2>
<p>An Iranian film, The Salesman, won the best foreign language film award after its director, Asghar Farhadi, refused to attend the ceremony as a protest against Trump's <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/immigration.html"> immigration </a> policies. Iran was on the list of seven countries.</p>
<p>A female Iranian astronaut, Anousheh Ansari, accepted the award on his behalf.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I'm not with you tonight," Farhadi said in a statement read by Ansari. "My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations who have been disrespected by the<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/spotlight/trump-muslims-ban.html"> inhumane law</a> that bans entry of immigrants to the US.</p>
<div data-embed-type="Brightcove" data-embed-id="5339268885001">

</div>
<p></p>
<p>"Dividing the world into the US and 'our enemies' categories creates fear - a deceitful justification for aggression and war."</p>
<p>It was the second Oscar for Farhadi, who won in the same category for A Separation in 2012.</p>
<p>Though  <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html"> Donald Trump </a> 's name was rarely mentioned during the ceremony, his policies were a running subtext throughout proceedings.</p>
<p>Several actors and actresses, including the Ethiopian Irish Ruth Negga who was nominated in the best actress category, wore blue ribbons in support of the American Civil Liberties Union, a high-profile civil rights group.</p>
<h2>Trump connnection</h2>
<p>Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, MC for the evening, did mention Trump several times.</p>
<p>"I want to say thank you to President Trump," Kimmel said as the ceremony opened.</p>
<p>"Remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?"</p>
<p>In 2015, criticism swirled around a lack of diversity among nominees, stirring a campaign that became known by the hashtag  <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=#OscarsSoWhite&src=typd" target="_blank"> #OscarsSoWhite </a> .</p>
<p>That criticism continued into 2016, with several people, including actor Will Smith, boycotting the ceremony.</p>

<p>A record six black actors were nominated this year, though, and a person of colour was nominated in each of the main acting categories - the first time that has happened.</p>
<p>On Friday, the directors of all five Oscar-nominated foreign language films, including Farhadi, had condemned what they described as a "climate of fanaticism and nationalism" in the US and elsewhere in a joint statement.</p>
<p>They said that, whoever won, the award would be dedicated to people working to foster "unity and understanding."</p>

<p><span>"Tonight is proof that art has no borders, no single language and does not belong to a single faith," academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs, who has worked to diversify its membership, said.</span></p>
<p>Mahershala Ali, an <span>Ahmadi Muslim, </span>won the best-supporting actor award for his role in Moonlight, which also won best picture.</p>
<p>In his acceptance speech, he announced the birth of his daughter and thanked his wife as well as "many wonderful teachers".</p>
<p>Celebrities had used the spotlight at earlier award shows to denounce the Trump administration’s stance on immigration, transgender rights and the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/media.html"> media</a>.</p>
<p><span> The Oscars is the highlight of the Tinseltown calendar, and wraps up two months of glittering prize galas.</span></p>
