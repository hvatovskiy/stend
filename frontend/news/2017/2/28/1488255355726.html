<p>It is late morning on 26 June 2015. He is on the beach in the Tunisian resort of Port El Kantaoui near Sousse. </p><p>The Islamist gunman Seifeddine Rezgui is in the midst of his shooting rampage targeting British and other European holidaymakers at the Imperial hotel.</p><p>Many are already dead. </p><p>Mr Pembroke is trying to comfort a badly-injured British woman, when suddenly he realises Rezgui has returned to the beach and is standing behind them, about to open fire.</p><p>Somehow he manages to grab the high-powered assault rifle and turn it so it is pointing into the air.</p><p>It is then that Mr Pembroke wakes up in a sweat after lashing out. Sometimes he throws punches in his sleep.</p><p>Almost two years after the attack, which he and his wife witnessed close-up, they are still struggling to overcome the trauma, despite destroying all photographs, documents and other memorabilia from the trip.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33300776" class="story-body__link">Who were the British victims?</a></p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-33304897" class="story-body__link">What exactly happened on the day?</a></p><p>"It's had a massive impact," says Mr Pembroke, 62, who works as a service manager at a car company in London.</p><p>"It's never going to go, and unfortunately since that day there've been several other terrorist incidents. </p><p>"With each incident, it's recall, we re-live the day. </p><p>"Even the start of the inquest... it just re-opens the wound."  </p><p>While many caught up in the attack ran for their lives when the shooting began, Mr Pembroke did something very different.</p><p>After hearing the first shots on the beach, he and his wife ran to their room a few metres away in a hotel next to the Imperial.</p><p>"While I am dragging her to the room, I could hear rapid gunfire, screaming, and bullets flying overhead," he said.</p><p>"I took her to the room and said, 'Stay there, please don't open the door, stay away from the window and lie on the floor.'"</p><p>Mr Pembroke then ran straight back to the beach towards the sound of the gunfire.</p><p>"I just wanted to helpâ€¦ I couldn't just secure myself in the room. I would have felt cowardly because I'd seen people go down, there was screaming.</p><p>"I thought, I've got some basic first aid skills, so let me see what I can do."</p><p>Among the sun loungers close to the water's edge, he found people lying in pools of blood with injuries so horrific he did not want the details to be repeated.</p><p>He also found Cheryl Mellor, still alive after being shot in the leg and arm, drifting in and out of consciousness.</p><p>"I asked her if she was English and she replied that she was. So I said, 'My name is Allen and I will do what I can to help.'"</p><p>Her hand had been blown off by the impact of a high velocity round from Rezgui's Kalashnikov rifle.</p><p>Mr Pembroke grabbed a scarf and tied it around her arm as a makeshift tourniquet and then used a towel to stem the bleeding from her leg.</p><p>But the most difficult task was yet to come.</p><p>Mrs Mellor wanted to know what had happened to her husband, Stephen, who was lying nearby with severe wounds to his chest.</p><p>Mr Pembroke checked his pulse but there was nothing.</p><p>"Do you really want to know?" Mr Pembroke asked.</p><p>"Yes," she replied. She passed out when he told her that her husband was dead.</p><p>Later he offered to carry her to safety but she insisted on staying next to her husband, saying she would play dead if the gunman returned to the beach.</p><p>He did, but she survived.</p><p>Mr Pembroke spent 20 minutes on the beach comforting Mrs Mellor and checking to see if any other holidaymakers who had been shot were still alive.</p><p>He says he was alone and no one else was helping.</p><p>"I saw no military or medical staff and it's only in recent reports that I found out that the police waited, they fainted, they hid. </p><p>"That's unforgivable, they need to be accountable for that."</p><p>By the end of the attack 38 people, including 30 Britons, were killed.</p><p>Rezgui was later shot dead by police. </p><p>Although still haunted by what he saw on that day, Mr Pembroke has tried to resume a normal life.</p><p>But he has taken on another job as well. </p><p>He is now a trained community first responder for the voluntary organisation, St John Ambulance.</p><p>He also remains in regular contact with Mrs Mellor, so they can help support each other.</p>
