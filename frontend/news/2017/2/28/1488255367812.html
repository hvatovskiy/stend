<p>Many of these bacteria have already evolved into deadly superbugs that are resistant to many antibiotics, the United Nations health agency said on Monday.</p>
<p>The bugs "have built-in abilities to find new ways to resist treatment" and can also pass on genetic material that allows other bacteria to become drug-resistant, it added.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Hotez, president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, said even people with healthy immune systems are now vulnerable.  </p>

<p>"It turns out that just about every country on the planet now has a problem with what we call AMR - antimicrobial resistance," Hotez told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>"This is a real wake-up call that we have three superbugs that seem to be widely resistant to antibiotics and we're running out of tools to combat them."</p>
<p>The WHO's assistant director-general for health systems and innovation, Marie-Paule Kieny, said it was up to governments to put in place policies to boost investment in research and development if new drugs are to be found in time.</p>
<p>"Just when resistance to antibiotics is reaching alarming proportions, the pipeline is practically dry," she told reporters in a telephone briefing.</p>
<p>"If we leave it to market forces alone, the new antibiotics we most urgently need are not going to be developed in time."</p>

<p>In recent decades, drug-resistant bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Clostridium difficile, have become a global health threat. Superbug strains of infections such as tuberculosis and gonorrhea are already untreatable.</p>
<p>WHO has previously warned many antibiotics could become redundant this century, leaving patients exposed to deadly infections and threatening the future of medicine.</p>
<p>The "priority pathogens" list has three rankings - critical, high and medium - according to how urgently new antibiotics are needed.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The critical group includes multidrug-resistant bacteria that pose a particular threat in hospitals, nursing homes, and other care facilities.</p>
<p>These include Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and various Enterobacteriaceae that can cause often deadly infections such as pneumonia and septicemia.</p>
<p>"These bacteria are responsible for severe infections and high mortality rates," Kieny said.</p>
<p>"While these bacteria are not widespread and do not generally effect healthy people, the burden for patients is now alarming and new effective therapies are imperative."</p>
<p>The second and third tiers contain other increasingly drug-resistant bacteria that cause more common diseases such as gonorrhea and food poisoning caused by salmonella.</p>

<p>WHO said the list is intended to spur governments to put in place policies that incentivise basic and advanced research and development.</p>
<p>Tim Jinks, head of drug resistant infections at the Wellcome Trust global health charity, said within a generation there could be up to 10 million deaths a year from drug resistant infections without new antibiotics. He said the list would be an important tool to steer research.</p>
<p>"Without new medicines to treat deadly infection, lifesaving treatments like chemotherapy and organ transplant, and routine operations like caesareans and hip replacements will be potentially fatal," Jinks said.</p>
