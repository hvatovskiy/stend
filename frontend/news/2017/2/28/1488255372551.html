<p>At a joint news conference on Monday in Austria with Sigmar Gabriel, <span>Sebastian Kurz</span>, who is known for his anti-immigration stance, said his government was overspending on refugees in his country.</p>
<p>Austria, a nation of 8.5 million people, became a key transit country for hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees entering the European Union in 2015, with tens of thousands of people requesting asylum there.</p>
<p><span>"We don't want to pay hundreds of millions of euros in family support for foreign children a year who don't even live in Austria," Kurz said.</span></p>

<p>"It is unfair to pay out these sums to the same extent when the costs of living are substantially less elsewhere."</p>
<p>Kurz has cited the success of the EU-Turkey deal in reducing the influx of migrants from outside Europe as something that can serve as a model for possible EU pacts with Libya and other North African countries.</p>
<p>Gabriel, however, suggested the comparison was flawed, arguing that the chaos and anarchy gripping Libya doomed such an agreement.</p>
<p>"We have a state in Turkey, whatever one's opinion about it is," he told reporters. "Not so in Libya."</p>

<hr>
<p>Gabriel also dismissed expectations that Tunisia would be able to host mass concentrations of migrants, warning that could be "destabilising" in a North Africa country that is struggling to nurture its fragile democracy.</p>
<p>The news conference came a day after Germany's interior ministry said that in 2016 Germany saw an average of 10 attacks a day against refugees, migrants and their shelters. </p>
<p>More than 2,500 refugees in Germany were attacked last year, according to the ministry, raising fears over the safety of those who have fled war and persecution.</p>
<p>The attacks left at least 560 people injured, including 43 children.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
