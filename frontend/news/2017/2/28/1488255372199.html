<p>The troops died in clashes early on Saturday in the remote Khojavend and Fizuli regions, but the <span>separatists prevented the recovery of the bodies until Monday,</span> <span>Azerbaijan's defence ministry said.</span></p>
<p><span><span>International mediators from the OSCE Minsk Group had called on the two sides "to keep heavy military equipment in its present positions and to allow recovery of the dead".</span></span></p>

<p>The rebels said in a statement: "Evacuation of bodies did not take place because Azerbaijan violated agreements."</p>
<p>The breakaway region's self-declared defence ministry accused Azerbaijan's military of trying to infiltrate its territory.</p>
<p>There were no casualties on their side, the separatists said.</p>
<p>Clashes over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which lies inside Azerbaijan but is controlled by ethnic Armenians, have stirred fears of a wider conflict breaking out in the South Caucasus, which is crisscrossed by oil and gas pipelines.</p>
<p>The conflict first erupted in 1991 and a ceasefire was agreed in 1994.</p>
<p>But Azerbaijan and Armenia regularly trade accusations of violence around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the Azerbaijan-Armenia border.</p>
<p>The ceasefire was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/04/fighting-rages-nagorno-karabakh-160404131621989.html">broken last April</a> when dozens were killed.</p>
<p>Efforts to secure a permanent settlement have failed despite mediation led by France, Russia and the US. </p>
