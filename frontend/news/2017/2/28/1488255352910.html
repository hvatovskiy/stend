<p>This is my standout look of the night. We've all been so excited to see Raf Simons' first work with Calvin Klein, and this white dress just perfectly encapsulates his directional take on femininity and glamour. Here his signature cool clean lines, with unexpected details like the cut out and the squared off train, are heightened by the stunning crust of sequins. And Naomie hasn't gone overboard with the details - simple hair, asymmetric crystal suede sandals, also by Calvin Klein, and Bulgari jewellery.</p><p>We often imagine that Oscar dresses should look like an old-fashioned fairy tale princess fantasy, and I love the idea that the modern fairy tale princess ideal is more pared back. Naomie looks amazing, and also entirely like herself - not over the top but incredibly glamorous. </p><p>I also love that Raf reached out to dress not just Naomi but her Moonlight co-stars, having seen the film and been blown away by it. It's a great example of fashion and Hollywood being inspired by each other.</p><p>Obviously it's great that Emma Stone won an Oscar while dressed a bit like an Oscar, but this dress is also just perfect - for her, the film she is nominated for and for the ceremony. </p><p>One of Riccardo Tisci's last designs before he stepped down from Givenchy, it exudes gilded era old-school glamour, just like La La Land, and the ombre fringing brings a playfulness that fits with Emma's whole vibe. Great jewellery too from Tiffany &amp; Co, and a dash of politics with the addition of a gold Planned Parenthood pin. </p><p>Pharrell is a guy who is always having fun with fashion, but after years where his style has been dominated by the big hat, it was really nice to see him graduate to looking unquestionably stylish - while still pushing the envelope. </p><p>This look is head-to-toe-to-necklace Chanel - not a brand you often see men wearing on the red carpet - but entirely in keeping with Pharrell's creative energy. </p><p>Nicole looks beautiful in this Armani Privé gown - she really is the master of what works for her and always looks exquisite. The shape reminds me of the vivid yellow John Galliano for Dior dress she wore to such acclaim in 1997. </p><p>Twenty years on, she has pared back the colour, but the glamour remains high octane, with the all-over embroidery and streamlined silhouette. I love her Harry Winston jewels too.</p><p>Dev really stood out for me. I love that he's a young British guy in the definitive British brand, Burberry. And that he's been brave enough to play with the classics, with the white jacket that fit so perfectly. </p><p>It's rare that you get excited about what the guys wear as they do so often stick to a formula - either boring or a little too much creativity - so seeing Dev combining creativity with cool was great. Also, having his mum as his date was classy as anything. </p><p>I love how French Isabelle looks, while still taking the glamour of the Hollywood red carpet seriously. She often wears trouser suits and tailoring for award shows, so it's interesting that she's chosen to go down the dress route. </p><p>This is by Armani Privé, which she has worn before and obviously trusts, and which is known for playing with a more androgynous style for women. It's demure but elegant, adding drama with the sequins. But the best bit for me is how she's styled it - adding edge with the Repossi ear cuff, laid back hair, deep lipstick and dark nail varnish. </p><p>She just looks so cool. </p><p>Such a wonderful moment for Davis winning her Best Supporting Actress award, and also a great moment of true, old-school Oscars glamour from her on the red carpet. Another one from Armani Privé, who were one of the most popular designers this year. While the gown is quite restrained in cut, the details bring it bang up to date - from the vivid red tone to the cutaway neckline and shoulder draping. </p><p>I love her hair too - really fresh and elegant.</p><p>Last year, Brie was a vision in blue Gucci when she won the Best Actress award. This year, she's gone a little darker and more grown up in this stunning ruffled Oscar de la Renta gown, designed by his successors Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim. </p><p>It's sleek but dramatic, without looking overdone at all. The Aquazzura shoes are a great touch, as is keeping everything else really simple - the ruffled hair and just earrings and a ring by Neil Lane. </p><p>I think she's making a statement with this ensemble, that's she's no longer an ingénue - and black velvet is a great way to say it. </p><p>I always look forward to seeing what Tom Ford wears on the red carpet, but in his absence Andrew Garfield nailed the dress code in this fantastic piece of Tom Ford tailoring. </p><p>The fabric, the texture, the cut - the combination is totally classic but feels fresh. In short, this is exactly what you want from a man in a tux.</p><p>This dress was probably the most fashion forward of the night - coming from designer of the moment Alessandro Michele at Gucci. I love the delicate champagne shade which offset the va va voom ruching and bow detail at the front. It's a great choice for a young starlet, sensual without being overtly sexy, considered without being laboured. </p><p>She's also kept everything else quite simple - aside from some staggering Cartier jewels. </p><p>It's great to see relationships between actors and designers develop. Michelle and Nicolas Ghesquiere at Louis Vuitton have been collaborating for years now, and the dresses she wears always seem to express their mutual understanding. This is quite a radical look - the low plunge of the neckline is a bit more revealing than what we are used to from Michelle, but it is beautifully offset by her gamine haircut and jewel-encrusted skirt. </p><p>Ghesquiere is great at forging relationships with some of the most interesting actresses - he's been working closely with Alicia Vikander for a couple of years now, and she looked great in a black lace Spanish-infused gown by him. In fact, both Michelle and Alicia prove how creative it can be to remain loyal to one designer. Neither of them ever look formulaic in Louis Vuitton - they always look like the dress has been designed specifically for them, to make them feel the most comfortable and chic.
