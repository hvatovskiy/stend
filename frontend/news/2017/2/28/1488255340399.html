<p>Since December, poultry has had to be kept indoors under government orders to prevent the spread of the disease.</p><p>Under European Union rules, if birds have been housed for more than 12 weeks they cannot be marketed as free range.</p><p>Farmers said the eggs would still look, taste and cost the same, despite the temporary re-labelling.</p><p>They pose no danger to consumers, but bird flu is highly contagious amongst poultry and can wipe out entire flocks.   </p><p>It has been 12 weeks since governments in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38231416" class="story-body__link">England</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-38233976" class="story-body__link">Scotland</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-38234292" class="story-body__link">Wales</a> ordered poultry keepers to protect their birds from a highly-infectious strain of avian flu in Europe. </p><p>The emergency measures are now being scaled back, but many farmers are keeping their hens indoors for the birds' protection.</p><p>To avoid confusion, the industry has decided to label free range egg cartons with stickers stating the contents were "laid by hens temporarily housed in barns for their welfare".</p><p>They started appearing on shelves last week, but will be rolled out fully on Wednesday.</p><p>"The need to change labelling of free range egg packs after 12 weeks is an EU requirement," said Mark Williams, chief executive of the British Egg Industry Council. </p><p>"However these are all still free range hens but some are temporarily housed to protect them from bird flu."</p><p>After weeks of being kept indoors, farmers would love nothing better than to let their birds back outside. </p><p>But it's a difficult balancing act. Get it wrong and a farmer could end up having his or her entire flock destroyed. </p><p>So the British Egg Industry Council (BEIC) has taken the unprecedented step of labelling all commercial boxes of free range eggs - whether hens are in or out - in order to create a level playing field for all farmers.  </p><p>Farmers say the label is just a technicality in any case as the hens are still free range, just temporarily housed to protect them from bird flu. </p><p>They hope consumers will be supportive, given that prices, for now, are staying the same. </p><p>But it's not an open-ended guarantee and they will all be hoping that things get back to normal by the end of April. </p><p>Mr Williams said: "Our research shows that consumers are supportive of farmers putting birds' health first and 80% are happy to continue to pay the same price, or more, for eggs from free range flocks temporarily housed inside."</p><p>There are four different types of eggs sold in the UK, all of which are stamped on the carton: organic, free range, barn-reared, and caged.</p><p>Hens laying free range eggs must have had unlimited daytime access to runs - fenced areas - with vegetation and at least four square metres of outside space per bird.</p><p>The UK has the largest free range flock in Europe - and farmers are trying hard to help the birds adapt to the new routine, according to BEIC. </p><p>Some are using footballs, plastic bottles and straw bales to stop the birds - which can normally peck whatever they want outside - from getting bored.</p><p>The hens also have continuous access to feed and water, and are already used to spending time inside because they go there at night, the BEIC points out. </p><p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the majority of farmers in England could let birds outside provided they follow "strict disease prevention measures".</p><p>"Producers in the higher risk areas could still market their eggs as free range, provided they use netting and meet other free range criteria," a Defra spokesperson said.</p><p>However, farmers pointed out that the average flock would require eight football pitches worth of netting, making it impractical and costly.</p><p>The BEIC said "continuing outbreaks of avian influenza across the UK and Europe" meant egg producers and their veterinary advisers remained concerned about the risk.</p>
