<p>There is currently no screening programme for the disease, so high-risk women are advised to have their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed.</p><p>In the trial on 4,348 women, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, cancers were detected earlier, when they should be easier to treat.</p><p>However, it is not yet clear if the regular blood test would save lives. </p><p>Breast and ovarian cancer runs in Caroline Presho's family. </p><p>The 43-year-old, from Hertfordshire, has inherited a genetic flaw called BRCA2. </p><p>"I'm a bit of a rubbish mutant," she told the BBC News website.</p><p>"I say it's like the X-Men, but I have the ability to develop cancer."</p><p><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cancer-of-the-ovary/Pages/Symptoms.aspx" class="story-body__link-external">NHS Choices: Ovarian cancer</a></p><p>Ms Presho was advised to have surgery to reduce risk, but having the ovaries and tubes removed starts the menopause.</p><p>She said: "I was always going to have surgery, but the screening allowed me to finish having my family, and I didn't want to go through the menopause at 35.</p><p>"It's very young and starting that early has a detrimental effect on cognitive function, bone and heart health." </p><p>Without screening, the only other option would be to keep an eye out for symptoms including:</p><p>About two in every 100 women will develop ovarian cancer at some point in their life.</p><p>But the study focused on women, like Caroline, who faced a greater than one-in-10 chance.</p><p>The trial, at 42 centres across the UK, monitored levels of a chemical called CA125 in women's blood.</p><p>Three times a year, doctors tracked changes in the levels of CA125, which is produced by ovarian tissue, to see if levels became elevated - a sign of cancer. </p><p>The women also had annual scans, and surgery if doctors thought cancer was likely. </p><p>During three years of screening and the year after the last test, 19 cancers were detected. Ten of them were at an early stage.</p><p>In the five years after that, 18 more ovarian cancers were detected.

However, the study has not been running for long enough to know if the screening saves lives. </p><p>While screening does detect cancer, tumours are far less likely to develop in the first place if women have surgery.</p><p>Prof Usha Menon, one of the researchers and a professor of gynaecological cancer from UCL, said: "What we're trying to do is get women to have surgery.</p><p>But she told the BBC News website: "From my point of view, women really struggle with this issue of menopause, and it seems like four-monthly screening is better than symptom awareness.</p><p>"The screening definitely picks up less advanced disease, but we cannot say for sure if we're saving lives."</p><p>Previous trials have <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35111443" class="story-body__link">produced insufficient evidence</a> for mass screening of all women. </p><p>And in the US, the Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm519540.htm" class="story-body__link-external">recently recommended</a> "against using currently offered tests to screen for ovarian cancer", including ones looking at CA125. </p><p>One potential issue is having a blood test could put women off surgery.</p><p>"This is what everyone's worried about," says Prof Menon.
