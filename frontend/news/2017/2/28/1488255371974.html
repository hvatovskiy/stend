<p><strong>ROMA IN EUROPE</strong></p>
<p>Between 10 and 12 million Roma are estimated to live in Europe, with most in eastern parts of the continent.</p>
<p>With ancestral roots in India, the Roma migrated to eastern Europe in the 10th century and have been persecuted throughout history.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Soviet Union and the break-up of Yugoslavia, many travelled west, seeking to escape poverty and discrimination.</p>
<p>In 2010, the European Union criticised France over a crackdown on illegal Roma camps launched by then-President Nicolas Sarkozy.</p>
<p>In the same year, thousands of Roma were deported to Romania and Bulgaria from France.</p>

<p>An appeals court on Monday in the southern city of Aix-en-Provence found Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 88-year-old founder of the National Front (FN) party, guilty of inciting hate and making racist and negationist statements with the comments at a press conference in Nice in 2013.</p>
<p>Le Pen said at the time: "It appears you have a problem with several hundred Roma who have an irritating and, let's say, smelly presence in this city."</p>
<p><span>Le Pen lost an appeal against the conviction.</span></p>
<p>It was the ninth time that Le Pen, who infamously repeatedly referred to the Holocaust as a "detail of history", has been convicted for such offences.</p>
<p>"I stick by these terms because it is what I think," Le Pen said at an earlier hearing.</p>
<p>"Jean-Marie Le Pen's words were extremely serious and an open call to hate and ethnic discrimination," said Sonny Phung of the anti-racism group SOS Racisme, which will receive 2,000 euros of Le Pen's fine.</p>
<p>The Roma minority largely come from Bulgaria and Romania, and are often stigmatised in France where they have been accused of being responsible for a rise in petty crime.</p>
<p>Le Pen was the runner-up in the 2002 presidential election that rocked the French political establishment.</p>

<p>In recent years, he has had a public falling out with his daughter after she took over the reins of the party and has sought to purge it of its more controversial elements.</p>
<p>Marine Le Pen is currently forecast to win the first round of France's presidential election on April 23 but lose the all-important May 7 runoff to either centrist Emmanuel Macron or conservative Francois Fillon.</p>
<p>However, polls show she has significantly reduced the projected margin of defeat in the past two months.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span>Â <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
