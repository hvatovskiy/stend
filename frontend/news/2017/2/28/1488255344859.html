<p>The blueprint will increase defence spending by $54bn (Â£43bn) but seeks to recoup that sum through deep cuts elsewhere, including to foreign aid.</p><p>Mr Trump's plan leaves large welfare programmes untouched, despite Republican calls for reform. </p><p>The president has consulted government agencies about his plans and will present his budget to Congress in May.</p><p>Between now and then, he needs to identify where the agencies can make savings and work out what he does with tax reform. </p><p>Republican John McCain said the $603bn defence budget - which was outlined by White House officials - would be insufficient.</p><p>Speaking at the White House during a meeting with state governors on Monday morning, Mr Trump said: "We're going to do more with less and make the government lean and accountable." </p><p>The president, who vowed to increase military spending and preserve welfare programmes during his campaign, said the budget will focus on "military, safety, economic development". </p><p>"It will include an historic increase in defence spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it," he said.</p><p>Military spending has declined in recent years due to budgetary battles in Congress that led to a spending freeze on defence. </p><p>However, it is still not uncommon for Congress to approve procurement of tanks, aircraft and ships that the Pentagon says it doesn't even need.</p><p>Mr Trump's proposal would return the US closer to wartime spending. </p><p>He also said he would spend "big" on infrastructure like roads and rails, but he has not yet revealed his tax plans.</p><p>Mr Trump pledged to cut taxes during his presidential campaign, which would probably add to the national debt, a figure that could hit $20 trillion on his watch. </p><p>Keeping both of his campaign promises - boosting the military and protecting welfare - will put the president in a tough bind.</p><p>If he wants to boost the defence budget by $54bn without adding to the deficit, that money will have to come from somewhere - and mandatory spending on welfare and debt interest takes nearly 70% of the budget off the table. </p><p>Early reports are that the Environmental Protection Agency is facing sharp cuts, but its total annual budget is just over $8bn - a drop in the bucket.</p><p>The State Department has also been singled out as a source for the needed funds, and its $50bn annually (including $22bn in direct aid) makes it a fatter target. </p><p>The lion's share of humanitarian assistance goes to rebuilding efforts in Afghanistan and Aids treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa, however, which will be difficult to touch. Also unlikely to get the axe is military support, dominated by $3.1bn annually to Israel.</p><p>There's a reason the Trump administration announced the military budget number before revealing where the money will come from. Spending is easy; cutting is hard.</p><p>The White House sent Mr Trump's 2018 budget blueprint, which begins on 1 October, to federal agencies on Monday.</p><p>The agencies will then review the plan and propose changes to the cuts as the White House prepares for negotiations with Congress. </p><p>The Republican-controlled Congress must approve any federal spending. </p><p>Mr Trump's plan is expected to face backlash from Democrats and some Republicans over the planned cuts to domestic programmes. </p><p>Congresswoman Nita Lowey, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said Mr Trump's plan is harmful to working families. </p>
