<p>Three female suicide bombers blew themselves up at a truck station on Friday, detonating vehicles at Muna Garage on the city's eastern outskirts, the Associated Press reported quoting Deputy Police Superintendent Victor Iskukwu.</p>
<p>The attack targeted refugees preparing to return to their home villages, according to witnesses that spoke to Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>Muna Garage has been attacked many times in recent months. </p>

<p><span>Two civilians were killed in the blasts and seven militia - known as self-defence fighters - were wounded, Ayub Ibrahim, a witness told the AP.</span></p>
<p><span>"Most of the trucks that were loaded with goods for export to Chad and the border communities were destroyed, along with commodities worth millions of naira," Ibrahim said.</span></p>
<p>Another blast took place as people were trying to board the trucks, said resident Isa Mamman.</p>
<p>The attack also targeted a military checkpoint, according to Ahmed Satomi, of the Borno State Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>Soldiers shot at gunmen on motorcycles who were escorting other suicide bombers, killing at least four of them.</p>
<p>A multinational force of troops from Nigeria and its neighbours last year drove Boko Haram out of towns and villages in northeast Nigeria, but isolated attacks and suicide bombings continue.</p>
<p>In December, President Muhammadu Buhari said the capture of a key camp marked the "final crushing" of Boko Haram in its last enclave in Sambisa forest, once the group's stronghold.</p>
<p>But since then, the group, which split into two factions last year, has stepped up its attacks.</p>
<p>One Boko Haram faction is led by Abubakar Shekau from the Sambisa forest. Abu Musab al-Barnawi leads the other faction, based in the Lake Chad region, which allies itself to Islamic State or Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).</p>
<p>The armed group's seven-year insurgency has killed 15,000 people and forced some two million from their homes.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
