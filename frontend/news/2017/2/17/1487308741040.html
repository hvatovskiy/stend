<p>The election of Donald Trump in November 2016 exposed a deep vein of distrust across the US, where millions became disillusioned with a political and corporate elite out of touch with the sentiments of ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>The institutions that serve US citizens are increasingly regarded as self-serving while the people are increasingly divided and polarised along racial and economic lines.</p>
<p>In this two-part series, <em>The Big Picture: The People vs America</em> we explore the construction and mythology of the American Dream and uncover the reality of exclusion and denial.</p>
<p>We chart the history of post-Second World War America to uncover how race has dominated the political landscape and continues to shape the America of today.</p>
<p>We also explore just how America became so fractured, and how for many, the American Dream has been lost.</p>
