<p>The Revenge Porn Helpline told BBC Radio 5 live it had received almost 6,000 calls and emails since it launched in January 2015, with three-quarters of callers women.</p><p>However, it warned it does not have government funding beyond March.</p><p>The government said more than Â£180,000 had been invested in the service and it would make a decision "in due course".</p><p>Revenge porn refers to the act of a partner or ex-partner deliberately distributing images or videos of a sexual nature without the other person's consent.</p><p>It became a crime in England and Wales in April 2015, with a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment.</p><p>Laura Bullock was 19 when she became a victim after an ex-boyfriend had hacked into her Facebook account.</p><p>She discovered that nude photos, meant for a new partner, had ended up on a number of porn sites.</p><p>"Initially I just broke down, I just didn't know what I was supposed to do," she told 5 live.</p><p>"My mum took me to the police station the next day, but that night I was in so much of a state and had to sleep in her bed because I just couldn't cope."</p><p>She advised victims of revenge porn to speak to someone as it was "the best thing" she did.</p><p>"If I didn't have my family and my friends, I don't even know if I would be sitting here today."</p><p>Ms Bullock added: "After everything that happened, I just couldn't be close to [my new partner].</p><p>"In my head I'd have people's comments from the sites and it just tore me up... I just had to end it."</p><p>She shared her diaries from the time with 5 live.</p><p>In one entry, she wrote: "I've never been 100% on the way my body looks because of spinal surgery in 2010, so thousands of people seeing my body was horrifying.</p><p>"Your body should be for you and close acquaintances to treasure, not for the pleasure of revenge porn site users."</p><p>In another, she wrote: "I feel like all these men who have seen me and left comments on the sites have been intimate with me, without my consent."</p><p>The helpline said revenge porn was a problem that affected teenagers to people in their 60s.</p><p>The helpline said it could not quantify the number of images online as new ones were uploaded every day across the world, but estimated it is many thousands.</p><p>It also shared anonymous examples of some of those who had sought help.</p><p>One person said: "I broke up with my ex about a year ago. He is messaging me constantly and ringing me.</p><p>"I don't like him, I don't want to be with him, but I have to pretend I do only because he is threatening to send my nudes to my sister and best friend and post them online.</p><p>"Yesterday he messaged me saying he will put me online and show everyone who I really am.</p><p>"I'm scared to tell anyone. I don't want my parents to find out anything."</p><p>Another said: "I broke up with my ex-partner in November.</p><p>"A few weeks afterwards, he told he had a concealed camera in his bedroom, and he had nude pictures of me and a video tape of a sexual nature.</p><p>"He began threatening me. In the beginning of January, he sent some images that he had.</p><p>"They were nude pictures taken of me whilst I was getting dressed in his bedroom,</p><p>"I was unaware at the time pictures were being taken of me and did not give my consent.</p><p>"The following day he contacted some of my work colleagues via Facebook, describing the images he had and asking if they wanted to see them."</p><p>The Revenge Porn Helpline, which is run by three people, offers support to victims and advice on how to gather evidence.</p><p>Laura Higgins, the helpline's manager, said it also contacts sites that are hosting revenge porn images to ask them to take them offline.</p><p>She said some sites "begrudgingly take down the images" while others refuse to do so, but social media sites have "really strong reporting" mechanisms to help.</p><p>Ms Higgins said the helpline was "extremely grateful" for the government's financial support, but said: "Without alternative funding in place, we are sadly at risk of losing this vital service.</p><p>"We are looking at various avenues of support, including charitable grants and commercial businesses, and will be launching a crowdfunding project shortly."</p><p>Ms Higgins added: "It's such a harrowing thing to find out that someone has abused your trust in some way.</p><p>"While some people are able to manage some of it on their own, don't suffer in silence."</p><p>A report released last autumn by the Crown Prosecution Service said that more than 200 people had been prosecuted since the revenge porn offence was brought in.</p>
