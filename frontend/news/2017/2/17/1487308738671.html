<p>The Montgomery, Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) said in <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2017/year-hate-and-extremism" target="_blank">a report </a>on Wednesday that the number of organisations opposing Muslims "leaped" from 34 in 2015 to 101 last year, as the total number of various hate groups remained at "near-historic highs, rising from 892 in 2015 to 917 last year".</p>

<p>SPLC also noted that FBI statistics showed that the rate of hate crimes against Muslims<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/fbi-hate-crimes-muslims-surge-67-percent-161114175259237.html" target="_blank"> rose by 67 percent</a> in 2015, when Trump, who used his election campaign to call for a travel ban against Muslims among other policies targeting ethnic and religious minority groups, became a popular political figure.</p>
<p>"The growth [of hate groups] has been accompanied by a rash of crimes targeting Muslims, including an arson that destroyed a mosque in Victoria, Texas, just hours after the Trump administration announced an executive order suspending travel from some predominantly Muslim countries."</p>

<p>"Without a doubt, Trump appealed to garden-variety racists, xenophobes, religious bigots and misogynists - people not necessarily in any hate or related kind of group, but who still were antagonistic toward multiculturalism," the report said.</p>
<p>In November last year, SPLC released a report saying that the US saw a<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/hate-incidents-spike-donald-trump-elected-161130161203648.html" target="_blank"> "national outbreak"</a> of hate incidents in the wake of Trump's presidential election.</p>
<p>It said that it documented nearly 900 hate incidents within the 10 days following Trump's election on November 8, but noted it was "almost certainly a small fraction of the actual number" because of under-reporting.</p>
<p>Many of the perpetrators invoked the president-elect's name during the incidents, indicating the surge was linked or motivated by his electoral win, the report said.</p>
