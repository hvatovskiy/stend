<p>NYFW is held twice a year - February and September - and this one focused on autumn/winter collections. </p><p>We'll leave aside the fact that Wednesday is nobody's idea of the end of the week and focus on some of the highlights instead.</p><p><strong>1. The hot convict's catwalk debut</strong></p><p>In 2014, 30-year-old convicted felon Jeremy Meeks was arrested during a gun sweep in California. But then something unusual happened.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/31740423/hot-criminal-jeremy-meeks-gets-modelling-contract" class="story-body__link">His mugshot went viral</a> after it was posted on the Stockton Police Department's Facebook page. </p><p>It received more than 15,000 likes and several users left comments like "hottest convict ever" and "Is it illegal to be that sexy?"</p><p>The blue-eyed bandit, as some fans branded him, was quickly snapped up by a modelling agent and his Instagram account now has 834,000 followers.</p><p>Philip Plein must have been one of those who had his head turned, as Meeks has now popped up on the catwalk of the designer's autumn/winter collection.</p><p><strong>2. The plethora of political statements</strong></p><p>The way things are at the moment, it would be much more groundbreaking if someone in the public eye <i>didn't</i> try to make a political statement.</p><p>Nonetheless, there were politics aplenty at NYFW, perhaps most notably on the runway for the Mara Hoffman collection.</p><p>The designer's show kicked off with opening remarks by the national co-chairs of the Women's March on Washington (pictured above).</p><p>The Women's March was an international protest against US president Donald Trump which took place last month.</p><p>Designers Public School also kitted out his models with hats reading "Make America New York" - a reference to President Trump's Make America Great Again campaign slogan.</p><p>Models were also seen wearing shirts with slogans such as "The Future is Female" and "We Will Not be Silenced".</p><p>It's unusual for fashion to dip its toes into the world of politics, but it seems even the most high-profile designers are keen to have their say on President Trump and his policies.</p><p><strong>3. The rise of plus-size</strong></p><p>This was not the first time that plus-sized models appeared at New York Fashion Week, but it may well be the most significant.</p><p>Previously, designers have included plus-size models, very often in frumpy outfits, to gain publicity for their show.</p><p>This time around, however, models like Ashley Graham (for Prabal Gurung) and Candice Huffine (for Michael Kors) were styled in a similar way to the other models.</p><p><strong>4. Kanye West didn't do anything controversial</strong></p><p>Or he might've done. We don't know, as he didn't allow any photographers into his Yeezy Season 5 runway show.</p><p>For all we knew he might have unveiled a new range of "Taylor Swift Rules" T-shirts. </p><p>All we had to go on from the show were some grainy photos and shaky mobile phone footage from those who flouted the photography rules.</p><p>However, all of the designs have now been posted online, making the camera ban somewhat pointless.</p><p>One thing we do know is Kanye refused to walk the runway at the end of his show, as is customary for the designer.</p><p>It seems that's about as controversial as it got. </p><p><strong>5. Michael Kors brought an orchestra</strong></p><p>No recorded hip-hop or dance music for Michael Kors's show, oh no. He brought an orchestra. </p><p>AN ORCHESTRA.</p><p>This is a seriously classy touch.</p><p><strong>6. The hijab catwalk show</strong></p><p>Indonesian Muslim designer Anniesa Hasibuan has made the hijab her trademark over the last two seasons.</p><p>This week, she built it into the outfits on display at her NY Fashion Week show, styling it with flowing gowns.</p><p>All of the models in Hasibuan's autumn/winter 2017 collection were seen with gray hijabs, signalling that such sightings on the catwalk could become more common.</p><p>Interviewed backstage, the designer said her dream would be to dress Kate Middleton, adding that she admires the Duchess of Cambridge for "her elegance". </p><p>Read more: <a href="/news/world-asia-37381770" class="story-body__link">When hijabs dazzled the New York catwalk</a></p>
