<p>In an interview with the BBC, the Facebook founder said that fake news, polarised views and "filter bubbles" were damaging "common understanding".</p><p>He said people had been left behind by global growth, sparking demands to "withdraw" from the "connected world".</p><p>In a call to action, he said people must not "sit around and be upset", but act to build "social infrastructures".</p><p>"When I started Facebook, the mission of connecting the world was not controversial," he told me.</p><p>"It was as if it was a default assumption that people had; every year the world got more connected and that seems like the direction things were heading in.</p><p>"Now that vision is becoming more controversial."</p><p>He told the BBC: "There are people around the world that feel left behind by globalisation and the rapid changes that have happened, and there are movements as a result to withdraw from some of that global connection."</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg's interview comes alongside the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-global-community/10154544292806634" class="story-body__link-external">publication of a 5,500-word letter</a> he has written about the future of Facebook and the global economy.</p><p>In it Mr Zuckerberg quotes Abraham Lincoln who spoke of acting "in concert", and talks about "spiritual needs", civic engagement and says that many people have "lost hope for the future".</p><p>"For a couple of decades, may be longer, people have really sold this idea that as the world comes together everything is going to get better," he said.</p><p><a href="/news/business-38999464" class="story-body__link">Ahmed: Zuckerberg lays out his vision</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-global-community/10154544292806634" class="story-body__link-external">Zuckerberg's manifesto on Facebook and the future</a></p><p><a href="/news/business-38991668" class="story-body__link">Read highlights from the interview with Facebook's founder</a></p><p><a href="/news/technology-38992657" class="story-body__link">Facebook AI 'will identify terrorists'</a></p><p>"I think the reality is that over the long term that will be true, and there are pieces of infrastructure that we can build to make sure that a global community works for everyone.</p><p>"But I do think there are some ways in which this idea of globalisation didn't take into account some of the challenges it was going to create for people, and now I think some of what you see is a reaction to that.</p><p>"If people are asking the question, is the direction for humanity to come together more or not? I think that answer is clearly yes.</p><p>"But we have to make sure the global community works for everyone. It is not just automatically going to happen.</p><p>"All these different kinds of institutions, whether they are governments, or non-profits, or companies, need to do their part in building this infrastructure to empower people so that it creates opportunities for everyone, not just some people.</p><p>"If you are upset about the direction things are going in, I hope you don't just sit around and be upset, but you feel urgent about building the long term infrastructure that needs to get built," Mr Zuckerberg said.</p><p>I asked him whether he felt President Trump agreed with his view that "bringing people together" and "connecting the world" would lead to greater progress.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg did not, famously, attend the round-table of technology leaders hosted by the new president.</p><p>"I don't think I am going to speak to that directly," he answered carefully. "You can talk to him, you can look at what he has said to get a sense of that.</p><p>"The thing that I will say is that a lot of folks will look at this through the lens of one or two events, and I really do think this is a broader trend.</p><p>"I have been talking about this for a long time, since before recent elections both across Europe and Asia and the US.</p><p>"A lot of today's biggest opportunities will come from bringing people together - whether that is spreading prosperity or freedom, or accelerating science, or promoting peace and understanding."</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg said: "A lot of challenges we face today are also entirely global - fighting climate change or ending terrorism, or ending pandemics, or when a civil war in one country leads to a refugee crisis across different continents.</p><p>"These are inherently global things and require a different level of infrastructure than we've had historically."</p><p>Would you like to meet President Trump? I asked.</p><p>"I would like that not be the focus of this. I don't really have much comment on that. It somewhat detracts from the focus of what we are trying to do here." </p><p>There has been speculation that Mr Zuckerberg could be contemplating a political career, and even suggestions that he will run for US president in 2020 - rumours he has flatly denied.</p><p>I said the political tone of the manifesto would do little to dampen speculation about where he sees himself longer term.</p><p>Could he imagine himself going into politics? "I am not doing that now, it's not the plan," he said. "The thing I really care about is connecting the world."</p><p>Facebook has been attacked for not doing enough to tackle "fake news" - untrue stories which claimed, for example, that the Pope backed Mr Trump - which have appeared prominently on its news feeds.</p><p>In Germany, there has been controversy after a Green MP was quoted in a Facebook post defending an asylum seeker from Afghanistan who had raped and murdered a German student.</p><p>The MP, Renate Kuenast, had never said what was attributed to her by a right-wing extremist organisation.</p><p>Ms Kuenast said she found it hard to accept that "Zuckerberg earns billions, shows off with all his charitable donations, and at the same time allows Facebook to become a tool of extremists".</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg said he understood the importance of tackling fake news.</p><p>"Accuracy of information is very important," he said in the 5,500-word letter, published on Thursday. "We know there is misinformation and even outright hoax content on Facebook.</p><p>"We've made progress fighting hoaxes the way we fight spam, but we have more work to do.</p><p>"We are proceeding carefully because there is not always a clear line between hoaxes, satire and opinion."</p><p>But Mr Zuckerberg added: "In a free society, it's important that people have the power to share their opinion, even if others think they're wrong.</p><p>"Our approach will focus less on banning misinformation, and more on surfacing additional perspectives and information, including that fact checkers dispute an item's accuracy."</p><p>He told me that "polarisation and sensationalism" also undermined "common understanding".</p><p>And he admitted that social media - which deals in short, often aggressive, messages - had been part of the problem.</p><p>"In some places [it] could over simplify important and complex topics and may push us to have over simplified opinions of them," Mr Zuckerberg said.</p><p>"And I think it is our responsibility to amplify the good effects and mitigate the negative ones so we can create a community that has a common understanding</p><p>"There is a lot of research that shows we have the best discourse when we connect as whole people rather than just opinions.</p><p>"If I get to know you on the values that we have in common or even the interests that we share it is a lot easier to have a debate about something that we disagree about productively than if we just meet and go head to head on something without understanding our common humanity."</p><p>Some may argue there is a question of legitimacy here, that no one voted for Mark Zuckerberg and question his right to outline - and attempt to execute - a vision of the world.</p><p>And what about those controversies over taxes paid, or privacy, or vast profits in an age when inequality is as much a factor behind the present dim view of many in the political and business establishment as any perceived failures of globalisation.</p><p>"There are a lot of areas that I know we need to improve and I appreciate the criticism and feedback and hope we can continue to do better on them," Mr Zuckerberg said, pointing out that he is donating 99% of his Facebook shares - worth Â£36bn ($45bn) - to the charitable foundation he runs with his wife, Priscilla Chan.</p><p>"Being a good corporate citizen is really important," he said. "We operate in a lot of different countries all around the world.</p><p>"We need to be help build those communities and that is what I am trying to do in my personal philanthropy - setting an example hopefully for other entrepreneurs who will build things in the future for how you should give back to the community and to the world.</p>
