<p>At an extraordinary White House news conference on Thursday, Trump said the new order would seek to address concerns raised by federal appeals court judges, who temporarily blocked his original travel ban.</p>
<p>"The new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision," Trump said. </p>

<p>"We had a bad court. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defence of our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result.</p>
<p>"We're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country."</p>
<p>Trump gave no details about the replacement order. Legal experts said a new directive would have a better chance of withstanding courtroom scrutiny if it covered some non-Muslim countries and exempted non-citizen immigrants living in the US legally.</p>
<p>The original order, issued on January 27, triggered chaos at some US and overseas airports, led to international protests, complaints from US businesses and drew more than a dozen legal challenges.</p>
<p>At his first solo press conference, Trump insisted there was "zero chaos" in his crisis-buffeted White House and railed against enemies in the media, politics and the courts.</p>
<p>The 70-year-old US president vented frustrations, insisted he is "not a bad person" and wondered out loud about a "nuclear holocaust", in a remarkable one hour 16 minute ask-me-anything appearance.</p>
<p>"I inherited a mess. It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess," Trump said in a 23-minute opening monologue that bore little resemblance to presidential press conferences of the past.</p>
<p>Claiming his administration "is running like a fine-tuned machine", the Republican accused the "dishonest" media of stirring-up crises that have sent his approval rating plummeting. </p>

<p>"The tone is such hatred. I'm really not a bad person, by the way," he said. "I do get good ratings, you have to admit that."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a retired navy admiral reportedly tapped by Trump to be his national security advisor has declined the post, US media said.</p>
<p>Robert Harward's rejection leaves Trump without a replacement for Michael Flynn, who resigned over a scandal involving his links with the Russian ambassador in Washington.</p>
<p>Officially Harward said he had turned down the job because of family and financial commitments.</p>
<p>In four tumultuous weeks, Trump has seen his national security adviser ousted, a cabinet nominee withdraw, a centerpiece immigration policy fail in the courts and a tidal wave of damaging leaks.</p>
<p>"There is zero chaos," Trump insisted, as he aired a litany of grievances.</p>
<p>"We have made incredible progress. I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done."</p>
<p>"This is a fine-tuned machine." </p>
