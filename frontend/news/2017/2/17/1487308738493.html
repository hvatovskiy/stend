        </div></hgroup></header><div id="Article-Top-Toolbar" class="ArticleTopToolbar"></div><figure class="article-main-image"><figcaption>Lee had been interrogated several times until his arrest on Thursday (EPA]</figcaption></figure><div id="article-body" class="article-body"><p>The heir of South Korean company Samsung has been arrested as part of an investigation into corruption and influence-peddling that caused President Park Geun-hye to be impeached.</p>
<p>The Seoul Central District Court's decision on Friday to issue a warrant to arrest Lee Jae-yong, 48, makes him the first leader in Samsung's history to be arrested on criminal charges.</p>
<p>Lee, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and son of the Samsung group head Lee Kun-hee, is accused of paying nearly $40m in bribes to Park's secret confidante to secure policy favours.</p>
<p>"It is acknowledged that it is necessary to arrest [Lee] in light of a newly added criminal charge and new evidence," a court spokesman said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>He was already being held at a detention centre after appearing in court on Thursday as judges deliberated whether to issue an arrest warrant.</p>
<p><span>Samsung is South Korea's largest business group and its revenue is equivalent to about a fifth of the country's GDP.</span></p>
<h2>Second arrest bid</h2>
<p><span>Lee had been interrogated several times over his alleged role in the scandal that has rocked South Korea in recent months.</span></p>
<p>He had narrowly avoided being formally arrested last month, after the court ruled there was insufficient evidence.</p>

<p></p>
<p><span><span>But prosecutors on Tuesday made a second bid for his arrest, saying they had collected more evidence in recent weeks.</span></span></p>
<p><span>His arrest is likely to send shock waves through the group, which is a major part of the South Korean economy.</span></p>
<p><span>Samsung Electronics, <span>the world's largest smartphone maker, </span></span>is already reeling from the debacle over the recall of its Galaxy Note 7 device and reports have suggested it could face sanctions from overseas authorities if Lee is punished.</p>
<p>The scandal centres on Choi Soon-sil, who is accused of using her close ties with Park to force local firms to "donate" nearly $70m to non-profit foundations which Choi allegedly used for personal gain.</p>
<p>Samsung was the single biggest donor to the foundations. It is also accused of separately giving millions of euros to Choi to bankroll her daughter's equestrian training in Germany.</p>
<p>The court is also deliberating an arrest warrant for another Samsung executive, who is also the head of Korea Equestrian Federation, over bribery charges.</p>
<h2>Controversial merger</h2>
<p>Samsung said in a statement on Wednesday it had "not paid bribes nor made improper requests to the president seeking favours".</p>
<p>Lee has effectively taken the helm of Samsung since his father suffered a heart attack in 2014.</p>
<p>Prosecutors are investigating whether Samsung had paid Choi to secure state approval for the controversial merger of two Samsung units seen as a key step towards ensuring a smooth power transfer to Lee.</p>
<p>The merger in 2015 of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries was opposed by many investors who said it wilfully undervalued the former unit's shares.</p>
<p>But the deal went through after Seoul's state pension fund - a major Samsung shareholder - approved it.</p>
