<p>The case is linked to a scandal that led to the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye.</p><p>Samsung is accused of giving donations to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a friend of Ms Park, in exchange for government favours.</p><p>Mr Lee and the Samsung Group deny any wrongdoing.</p><p>The acting Samsung chief was first questioning by prosecutors in January, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38660128" class="story-body__link">but they decided then not to arrest him</a>. </p><p>But he was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38952744" class="story-body__link">questioned for a second time</a> earlier this week. </p><p>On Friday, the court said it "acknowledged that it is necessary to arrest [Lee Jae-Yong] in light of a newly added criminal charge and new evidence."</p><p>The prosecution will now investigate further have 20 days to file formal charges. The arrest does not reflect a court opinion on guilt or innocence but only means it considers the potential crime very serious or that it assumes a flight risk. </p><p>Prosecutors accused Mr Lee of giving donations worth 41bn won ($36m;Â£29m) to organisations linked to Ms Park's close friend Ms Choi. They alleged this was done to win government support for a big restructuring of Samsung that would help a smooth leadership transition in favour of Mr Lee, who is standing in as chairman for his ill father, Lee Kun-hee.</p><p>The controversial merger required <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-38448364" class="story-body__link">support from the national pension fund</a> - the allegation is that this support was granted in return for the donations. </p><p>In a December parliamentary hearing, Samsung admitted giving a total of 20.4bn won to two foundations, but denied seeking favours in return.</p><p>Mr Lee also confirmed the firm gave a horse and money to help the equestrian career of Ms Choi's daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, something he said he now regrets.</p><p>This centres around President Park's ties to Ms Choi and has brought allegations of cult activities, influence-peddling and leaks of classified information.</p><p>Ms Choi is a long term family friend whose father had already had close ties with President Park's father who was president in the 1970s. </p><p>As well as soliciting donations, Ms Choi is accused of using their friendship to interfere in politics. </p><p>She is now on trial charged with various offences, including abuse of authority, coercion and attempted fraud, and denies wrongdoing. </p><p>Parliament voted <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-38259984" class="story-body__link">in December to impeach President Park.</a> Her case is now being heard by the constitutional court. Meanwhile she has been stripped of her presidential powers. </p><p><a href="/news/world-asia-37820112" class="story-body__link">A friendship too far in Seoul?</a></p><p>Mr Lee is currently vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics. But since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack in 2014, he is considered de facto boss of the entire Samsung Group conglomerate.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome, a trial is a big blow to the company. His arrest may not affect short term production or the running of the firm but there could be long term implications. </p><p></p>
