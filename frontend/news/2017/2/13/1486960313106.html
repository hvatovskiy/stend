<p>Mike Pompeo, making his first overseas tour since being confirmed as CIA chief in late January, made the presentation to Crown Prince Muhammed bin Nayef at a weekend ceremony, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said.</p>
<p>Bin Nayef, 57, has been interior minister since 2012 and has years of experience in intelligence work.</p>
<p><span>He </span>oversaw a crackdown on al-Qaeda, a group that killed security officers and foreigners in the kingdom between 2003 and 2007.</p>
<p>In 2009 Bin Nayef survived an assassination attempt by al-Qaeda. </p>
<p>Pompeo awarded him the George Tenet Medal in recognition of his "excellent intelligence performance, in the domain of counter-terrorism and his unbound contribution to realise world security and peace".</p>
<p>George Tenet was the CIA's longest-serving director, from 1996 to 2004, and helped to spearhead the country's military invasions into both Afghanistan and Iraq. </p>
<p>Pompeo and Nayef also held talks on security issues, SPA said.</p>
<p>The prince told SPA that "no attempt will succeed in driving a wedge between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the US".</p>
<p>It was the latest Saudi reaffirmation of ties between the Islamic monarchy and Washington since President Donald Trump took office on January 20.</p>

<p>The US and Saudi Arabia have a decades-old relationship founded on the exchange of American security for Saudi oil.</p>
<p>But ties between Riyadh and Washington became increasingly frayed during the eight-year administration of former president Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's Sunni leaders felt Obama was reluctant to get involved in the civil war in Syria and was tilting towards its Shia-dominated rival Iran.</p>
<p>Pompeo is a strident critic of an <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/07/iran-world-powers-clinch-historic-nuclear-deal-150714042342330.html" target="_blank">international deal</a> reached in 2015 to lift sanctions on Iran in exchange for guarantees that it would not pursue a nuclear weapons capability.</p>
<p>In interviews and written pieces, Pompeo has pointed to Iran as the primary source of conflict in the Middle East since Tehran's 1979 revolution - views that coincide with those of Riyadh.</p>
<p>Pompeo was in Turkey late last week for talks with officials.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
