<p>Pensioners are also now more likely than their predecessors to still be in work, own a home and have access to generous private pensions, it adds.</p><p>The think tank says growth in pensioner incomes has been coupled with weak income growth for working-age people.</p><p>Pensioner households are now £20 a week better off than working age households, but were £70 a week worse off in 2001.</p><p>However, the report, called As Time Goes By, adds: "This strong growth is not the result of a boom time for all pensioners, with most finding that their personal situation changes little from year-to-year. "</p><p>It says while typical incomes across the pensioner population have grown by more than 30% since 2001, the typical income of someone who turned 65 in that year was only 7% higher by 2014.</p><p>Adam Corlett, Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: "The main driver of pensioner income growth has been the arrival of successive new waves of pensioners, who are more likely to work, own their home and have generous private pension wealth than any previous generation.</p><p>"Of course, not all pensioners can draw on these income sources, which is why the state pension will always be the main income for many pensioners. </p><p>"We can't assume either that young people today will be able to draw upon the kind of wealth that recent pensioners have accumulated, given the recent fall in home ownership and decline in generous defined benefit schemes."</p><p>The report identifies four key drivers of growth in typical pensioner incomes since the 2000s.</p><p>These are: the possession of occupational pensions, a growth in the numbers in employment, increased state benefits, and a move towards home ownership from renting. </p>
