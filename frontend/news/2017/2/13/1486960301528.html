<p>His company and website Freelancer has a simple concept - it connects people who have work they need doing with others who compete to do the task by submitting the fee they would charge.</p><p>Founded just eight years ago in Sydney, today the website has more than 22.5 million users around the world, both freelance workers and those seeking their services.</p><p>Jobs advertised on Freelancer include everything from help with building a mobile phone app, to writing a company report, designing a tattoo, and help with gaining publicity for something.</p><p>US space agency Nasa has even used the website since 2015, allowing people to bid to help design items for the International Space Station, including a new robotic arm.</p><p>It is a pretty good success story for a 43-year-old who admits that when he came up with the idea for Freelancer he was "a broken man".</p><p>In 2006 Mr Barrie had walked out of his first start-up - a Sydney-based firm called Sensory Networks that made computer chips for security equipment. He was not feeling good.</p><p>"People used the product but everything was wrong with how we sold it," he says.</p><p>Despite a blaze of publicity and the support of venture capitalists (VCs), the marketing proved too tough, and the company was struggling. So Mr Barrie quit.</p><p>"You feel you have left your VCs down, the board, your friends that you hired, your family," he says.</p><p>Sensory Networks went on to survive without Mr Barrie, and was eventually bought by chip giant Intel in 2013 for $20m, but he says that back in 2006 he "really felt like a failure".</p><p>After a few months of "decompressing", Mr Barrie was beginning to think about his next move when the 2007 global financial crisis swept in.</p><p>"The whole world was collapsing. Businesses weren't getting funded anymore. I thought, 'what am I going to do with myself?'" he recalls.</p><p>He decided to take advantage of the enforced downtime to build a website for his mother, a wholesale art and craft supplier.</p><p>He wanted to include a directory of the stores she supplied, thinking it might encourage others to want to be included. The first Excel spreadsheet had 1,000 rows.</p><p>Faced with that, Mr Barrie decided to outsource the data entry side of things to local kids. But even offering A$2,000 overall, nobody came running. </p><p>"I looked around, asked a few people, and they'd say, 'oh it's boring.' I'd reply, 'I know it's boring! That's why I want you to do it.'"</p><p>After four months Mr Barrie started searching online in desperation for cheap data entry, and stumbled upon a site based in Sweden called Getafreelancer.</p><p>"It was the ugliest site you have ever seen in your life. I eventually figured out how to post a job," he says.</p><p>"I went to get lunch, and came back to 74 emails from people saying you're offering A$2,000, I'll do it for A$1,000, A$500 and so onâ€¦ I thought it was a scam."</p><p>He eventually hired a team in India who did the job in three days for A$100.</p><p>"I thought was incredible, a whole army of people out there, many from emerging markets. I looked at all the projects on the website. It was like an ebay for jobs. I thought wow.</p><p>Mr Barrie was so impressed by the concept that he decided to set up his own version.</p><p>The VCs who had flocked to his first start-up were far more cautious this time round, and banks were unwilling to loan to a web-based business with no physical, recoverable assets in the event of failure.</p><p>In the end a friend who had sold his own firm stumped up the money, and Mr Barrie first secured workers via Getafreelancer, before then buying that business.</p><p>Freelancer, whose entire operation is cloud-based using Amazon Web Services, has since gone on to buy up 18 other rival sites. Its directly employed workforce now totals 570 people.</p><p>Sites like Freelancer have faced criticism for driving down prices for professionals trying to sell their services, but Mr Barrie counters that the company has had a huge, positive impact on millions of people in developing countries.</p><p>"You can be somewhere where your average wage is A$2 a day," he says.</p><p>"The average project [on Freelancer] pays A$200. </p><p>"You can make your month's salary in a few days. It's the ultimate meritocracy. It's up to you to figure out what you want to do."</p><p>And it is also not necessarily the lowest bidder who wins the job - Freelancer says that 47% of the projects on its site are awarded to "the median bidder or higher".</p><p>Entrepreneur Emma Sinclair, co-founder of human resources software business Enterprise Jungle, says firms are increasingly looking to hire non-staff to complete projects rather than carry out the work in-house.</p><p>"Nearly 35% of today's total workforce is comprised of non-employee workers and this is set to continue to grow," she says</p><p>"Sites like Freelancer are therefore very well-placed to service both the growing on-demand labour force looking for work, as well as the corporates who are hiring them.</p><p>"It is an invaluable marketplace for talent, with an all-important rating system to weed out the poor or unreliable performers." </p><p>On a day-to-day basis Mr Barrie is, by his own admission, a workaholic.</p><p>"I live this, I breathe it. I get up in the morning and start work. I'm often in the office until 10pm.</p>
