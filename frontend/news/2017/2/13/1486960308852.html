<p>Various US governments have threatened to cut its funding or even have it moved out of its headquarters in New York.</p>
<p>But the US is still the biggest financial backer of the agency.</p>
<p>Now, US President Donald Trump's administration is <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/objects-palestinian-envoy-libya-170211033508144.html">rejecting the UN's nominee</a> - Salam Fayyad - for the role of peace envoy to Libya.</p>
<p>Fayyad is a former Palestinian prime minister.</p>
<p>The UN says he would be serving in a personal capacity, and not as a representative of any government.</p>
<p>But <span>Nikki Haley,</span> the new US ambassador to the UN, is moving to block his appointment.</p>
<p>She says Trump's administration is "very disappointed" at his selection for this role because in her words, to "the detriment of Israel'.</p>
<p>So, are these signs of a growing rift between a superpower and an organisation meant to bring the world together?</p>
