<p>The California Department of Water Resources said on Facebook at about 00:30 GMT on Monday that the spillway of California's Oroville Dam was "predicted to fail within the next hour".</p>
<p>While it was still standing nearly three hours later, the Water Resources department said crews would use helicopters to drop rocks to fill a gouge in the spillway.</p>
<p>Authorities were also releasing water to lower the lake's level.</p>
<p>Officials said the cities of Oroville, Gridley, Live Oak, Marysville, Wheat land, Yuba City, Plumas Lake, and Olivehurst were all under evacuation orders.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Butte County sheriff said in a statement posted on social media: "Immediate evacuation from the low levels of Oroville and areas downstream is ordered, This is NOT A Drill."</p>
<p>Doug Carlson, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said water levels on Friday were over 273 metres, less than 2 metres from the top.</p>
<p>Evacuation centers were set up at a fairgrounds in Chico, California, about 20 miles northwest of Oroville, but roads leading out of the area were jammed as residents sought to drive out of the flood zone.</p>
<p>The Oroville dam is nearly full after weeks of heavy rains and snow brought relief to the state after some four years of devastating drought.</p>
<p>At 230 metres high, the structure, built between 1962 and 1968, is the tallest dam in the US, besting the famed Hoover Dam by more than 12 metres.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
