<p>Rupinder Randhawa had been feeling "very low" after her solicitor told her it was hopeless to pursue a court battle for custody of her children.</p><p>The mother-of-four had wanted to fight the adoption of her youngest two children, instigated by social services. </p><p>"I was not in a great space," she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, "but I was still willing to fight for my children." </p><p>Then, she came across David Bright, who ran The Parent's Voice London, a service that provided McKenzie friends. </p><p>Bright told Ms Randhawa he had "never lost a case" and charged her £480 a month, plus additional one-off charges, to work on her case as a McKenzie friend. </p><p>She subsequently lost her case and is no longer fighting the adoption of her children. </p><p>After this, Bright asked Ms Randhawa for an additional £6,000 to pay for a book to be published about her case, which he said would help her win her children back. </p><p>She paid him, but no book was ever published. </p><p>"I felt like I'd been conned," she said. "I felt my whole world came crashing around me, because there was no hope in getting my children back."    </p><p>Bright was a director of The Parents' Voice, and both he and fellow director Claire Mann were jailed last year for perverting the course of justice in a case separate to Ms Randhawa's. </p><p>Bright denies any wrongdoing, and says he and The Parents' Voice "helped hundreds of families".</p><p>When families break up and there is a dispute over the custody of children it can end up in the family court.</p><p>But since changes to legal aid in 2013, it is more difficult for parents to get funding to help with their costs in these cases - which is why some are turning to McKenzie friends as a cheaper alternative.</p><p>There is presently no regulation of these services.</p><p>Stephen - not his real name - came across the The Parents' Voice after his marriage broke down and his ex-wife took custody of their children.  </p><p>He said Bright initially "just sang to my ears". </p><p>"He told me exactly what I wanted to hear," Stephen said. </p><p>"He asked me if I wanted custody. He asked me how much I wanted to see the kids."</p><p>But, he said, Bright took more than £12,000 from him, by charging him twice and for work he did not do. </p><p>Both Stephen and Ms Randhawa won county court judgements against David Bright and The Parents' Voice, for more than £10,000 each for work that was not carried out. </p><p>There have also been several other successful claims against the company. </p><p>Jenny Lewington worked  for The Parents' Voice as a McKenzie friend before stopping in a dispute over payment. </p><p>She was also disturbed by some of David Bright's working practices.</p><p>"I'd gone to the hearing with a mother who was trying to appeal an adoption and [David Bright] had submitted the wrong form to apply for the appeal," she said. </p><p>Mrs Lewington said he had then told her he "did it to try and delay matters".</p><p>Ultimately the mother lost her case, and Mrs Lewington felt The Parents' Voice had given her false hope that she could win. </p><p>Senior judges have been considering making changes to the way paid-for McKenzie friends operate. </p><p>Among proposals in a consultation last year was the introduction of a code of practice.</p><p>The Law Society, which represents solicitors, has called for a ban on McKenzie friends being able to recover costs in court cases, to underline the fact that they are different to solicitors or barristers. </p><p>Richard Miller, from the Law Society, said: "One of our concerns about the rise in paid-for McKenzie friends is that a lot of these people are effectively acting as lawyers and advertising themselves as lawyers.</p><p>"But they do not have legal training and legal qualifications, and they do not have the duties to the court that a qualified lawyer does."</p>
