<p>The US university said on Saturday it would rename Calhoun College after Grace Hopper College, a female Yale alumnus who invented a pioneering computer programming language and became a Navy rear admiral.</p>
<p>Yale said it was the final decision in a controversy over former US Vice President John C. Calhoun's legacy that had simmered for years and boiled over with campus protests in 2015.</p>
<p>Four people were arrested in a peaceful protest as recent as Friday after they blocked street traffic.</p>

<p>Peter Salovey, Yale president, said the name change was not a decision "we take lightly" but that Calhoun's legacy as "a national leader who passionately promoted slavery as a 'positive good' fundamentally conflicts with Yale's mission and values".</p>
<p>Salovey held a different opinion last year, when he said the name would be kept, despite protests.</p>
<p>"At that time, as now, I was committed to confronting, not erasing,our history," Salovey said. "I was concerned about inviting a series of name changes that would obscure Yale's past."</p>
<p>University officials also said that the symbols of Calhoun on campus will not be removed, such as engravings and a statue atop the landmark Harkness Tower.</p>
<h2>'No corrective move'</h2>
<p>Chris Rabb, a 1992 Yale graduate told the AFP news agency that just changing the name from a "bad person to a good person" is not enough.</p>
<p>Rabb has spoken out against the name since his own days living at Calhoun College. He successfully lobbied for the removal of a stained glass window depicting a black man in shackles kneeling before Calhoun.</p>
<p>"I'm underwhelmed," said Rabb, an educator and state representative in Pennsylvania who co-founded an alumni network for black Yale graduates.</p>
<p>"This choice makes no corrective move toward reconciliation in light of not just the legacy of John C. Calhoun, but Yale University's ties to slavery and systemic racism."</p>
<p>Calhoun, a member of the Yale class of 1804, was a senator from South Carolina and a leading voice for those opposed to abolishing slavery. He served as US vice president from 1825 to 1832.</p>
<p>The decision to name one of Yale's 12 colleges after him in 1931- and decorate it with depictions celebrating plantation life - was controversial at the time and triggered demonstrations by black students.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
