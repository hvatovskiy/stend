<p>The pop star was given the night's top honour for her multi-million selling record 25, but told the audience, "I can't possibly accept this award".</p><p>"I'm very humbled and I'm very grateful, but Beyonce is the artist of my life".</p><p>Adele's victory over Beyonce is certain to boost complaints that the Grammys habitually overlook black artists.</p><p>Several artists, including Frank Ocean and Kanye West, chose to skip this year's ceremony on that basis.</p><p>Ocean even declined to submit his critically-acclaimed album, Blonde, for consideration, saying the Grammys did not "seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down".</p><p>Two years ago, West stormed the stage when Beyonce was beaten to the best album title by Beck's Morning Phase.</p><p>However, Adele's 25 was by far the biggest-seller on this year's shortlist; outselling Beyonce's Lemonade by a factor of 10 to 1.</p><p>It is unclear if Adele will officially reject her award. If she does, it would only be the second time in history that has happened.</p><p>The last was in 1990, when Sinead O'Connor turned down best alternative album for  I Do Not Want What I Have Not Got, claiming the ceremony was too "commercialised".</p>
