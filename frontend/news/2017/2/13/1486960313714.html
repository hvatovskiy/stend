<p>Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, 59, faces eight other candidates including subordinate regional officials, the director of a government-owned oil refinery and a representative of the country's state agribusiness complex.</p>
<p>But these other men are completely loyal to <span>Berdymukhamedov,</span> who rose to power suddenly following the death of predecessor Saparmurat Niyazov in 2006.</p>
<p>"The opposition candidates are fairly irrelevant to the extent that people have been recruited from within the regime or the government departments, they are just a facade to show that the recoronation of the president ends up successfully," Luca Ancheski, a specialist on Turkmenistan at the University of Glasgow, told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>Voting in the country of over five million people began at 7:00am (02:00 GMT) and will continue until polling stations close at 7:00pm (14:00 GMT), the central electoral commission confirmed.</p>

<p>Berdymukhamedov, a dentist by training, has kept in place Niyazov's repressive political system which tolerates no political opposition or public expressions of discontent.</p>
<p>"There is no position or opinion of [Turkmen] on the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/election.html">elections</a>, when there is no media which makes the assessment of what people really think," Ancheski said.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera's Central Asia expert, Mutiullah Tayeb, said the latest report by Reporters Without Borders mentions the crackdowns on some independent journalists in the country.</p>
<p>"In the absence of a powerful opposition, and the crackdown on <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/press-freedoms.html">press freedom</a>, I don't see any real changes in the near future," Tayeb said.</p>
<p>In the previous election in 2012, Berdymukhamedov won 97 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>Last year, Turkmenistan amended its constitution in a way that could allow Berdymukhamedov to stay in power indefinitely, removing the 70-year age limit for presidential candidates and extending the presidential term to seven years from five.</p>
<p>"Despite some superficial changes in the democratic decor by allowing some unknown competitors in the election race, a real change is far away. Turkmenistan will remain one of most authoritarian states so far," Tayeb told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>This consolidation of power has been taking place against a background of slowing economic growth and shortages of foreign currency due to Russia's decision to halt imports of Turkmen natural gas, Ashgabat's main source of export revenue.</p>

<p>Moscow had long been the main buyer of Turkmen gas and sales to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/china.html">China</a>, although significant, have not completely offset the loss of Russian money flows.</p>
<p>Faced with budget deficits after years of surpluses, the authorities are considering scaling down a generous welfare system which includes free petrol rations.</p>
<p>Amid the gas fight, Turkmenistan has also flatly rejected the idea of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/russia.html">Russia</a> providing military assistance to the Central Asian nations in the light of escalating violence in neighbouring <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/afghanistan.html">Afghanistan</a>; it has also vehemently denied claims of violent incidents at the Afghan border.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
