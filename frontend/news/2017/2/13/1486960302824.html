<p>Set up just a few years ago, Provenance says it is lighting a fire under the retail world. </p><p>The company is based around an app which allows retailers and customers to see where a product comes from, from its origins to its point of sale. </p><p>"Behind every product is a complex chain of people and places and that's a really important part of why people buy things," Ms Baker explains. </p><p>"Provenance is all about making that information transparent to shoppers but also to businesses all along the supply chain."</p><p>But it began with her mother Jenny. </p><p>"She's a pioneer of conscious consumption," Ms Baker says. </p><p>"She raised me, my brother and sister, to care about what we eat and buy, but also helped us understand from an early age where things come from.</p><p>"For a long time, I think most of our meals came from under one mile from our home in Wiltshire, vegetables from the garden and animal products from our neighbour's farm." </p><p>While training to be a manufacturing engineer, Ms Baker visited dozens of supply chains to see how different products were sourced and created. But the breakthrough came in 2013, when she was studying for a PhD in computer science and started to look into the emerging blockchain technology. </p><p>"You can think of a blockchain," Ms Baker says, "as a shared data system that everyone can use in order to be able to trust information. What it's allowed us to do is to have a shared system of record that nobody can tamper with and everybody can see."</p><p>Provenance uses this technology to log and store every stage of a supply chain in a way that anyone can access. </p><p>Now the company, which started as a part-time interest while Ms Baker was studying, has become a full-time business. She has put her PhD on hold, as she's busy running a company with 10 staff based in four countries: the UK, the US, France and Germany. </p><p>"We have no physical things apart from our laptops," Ms Baker points out. "So we can move the team wherever we want to around the world."</p><p>The company started out working with small brands and, in July 2016, signed its first commercial client, the UK's fifth largest food and grocery retailer, the Co-op. Provenance is now helping the Co-op track fresh products through its supply chains. </p><p>"We've attracted lots of pioneering food and drinks businesses," Ms Baker says.</p><p>"It's as much about reassuring businesses that they are selling things that are correct and trustworthy as it is about consumers being able to understand that as well." </p><p>Provenance's first victory for sourcing ethical products came with a humble fish. </p><p>In early 2016 in Indonesia, Provenance tracked the first fish on the blockchain.</p><p>Working with a non-governmental organisation to certify a socially sustainable catch of fish, the company in effect created a digital passport for the fish.</p><p>Provenance has now set up partnerships with tagging, DNA scanning and digital imaging companies to strengthen the connections between physical products and their digitised claims. </p><p>As well as fish, Provenance now tracks other foods, such as eggs and dairy. It says that lots of products, not just food, can be tracked and sourced in this way. </p><p>But Ms Baker admits that there are still some issues with the scaling up of the technology. </p><p>"We're on the bleeding edge of a new technology and occasionally having to wait for it to get developed a bit more in order to be able to develop on top of it," she says. </p><p>Another problem is the reputation of blockchains.</p><p>"The main challenge for Provenance is that it's being built upon a technology that is relatively immature," she says.</p><p>"There are still some risks that are unclear, but we're beginning to see blockchains being used in really quite a wide variety of applications.  It is potentially a much simpler way of transacting."</p><p>But Ms Baker has a long-term vision.</p><p>"We are disruptive and we're trying to disrupt the industry for good." she says. </p>
