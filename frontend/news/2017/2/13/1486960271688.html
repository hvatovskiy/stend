<p>The device was described as a "surface-to-surface medium-to-long-range ballistic missile", the Korean state news agency KCNA reported.</p><p>South Korea's defence ministry called it an armed provocation to test the response of US President Donald Trump.</p><p>North Korea's latest ballistic missile test has been widely condemned. </p><p>The US, Japan and South Korea have requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the incident. </p><p>KCNA reported that the test of the Pukguksong-2 missile, a new type of strategic weapon said to be capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, was overseen by leader Kim Jong-un.</p><p>It added that the missile was fired at a high angle in consideration of neighbouring countries.</p><p>The rocket used a solid-fuel engine, the report said, which gives ballistic rockets greater power and range.  </p><p>South Korea military experts said the rocket had been launched by a "cold-eject" system, which uses compressed gas for its initial thrust, a system employed for submarine-launched missiles.</p><p>The report also said that Kim Jong-un "expressed great satisfaction" over the test launch, which it said "adds to the tremendous might of the country".</p><p>South Korea and US officials said the missile flew east towards the Sea of Japan for about 500km (300 miles).</p><p>The missile reached an altitude of about 550km (350 miles), the South Korean military said. </p><p>Experts suggest the tests are programmed for shorter distances to avoid a missile landing on Japan.</p><p>This was the latest in a series of tests in the past year, including North Korea's fifth of a nuclear device.</p><p>The launch took place at 07:55 local time (22:55 GMT Saturday) from the Panghyon air base in North Pyongan province on the west side of the Korean peninsula.</p><p>United Nations resolutions forbid North Korea from carrying out ballistic missile tests - part of wider efforts to prevent it becoming a fully nuclear-armed power. </p><p>South Korea's foreign ministry said that "North Korea's repeated provocations show the Kim Jong-un regime's nature of irrationality, maniacally obsessed in its nuclear and missile development".</p><p>Nato also condemned the missile test, with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urging North Korea "not to raise tensions further and to re-engage in a credible and meaningful dialogue with the international community".</p><p>The European Union joined the criticism, declaring in a statement that North Korea's "repeated disregard of its international obligations is provocative and unacceptable".</p><p>Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, standing next to Mr Trump on a visit to the United States, said the test was "absolutely intolerable".</p><p>As for the US, Mr Trump said on Saturday: "America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100%."</p><p>China, North Korea's closest ally, has yet to comment. Beijing has joined in international efforts to press Kim Jong-un to rein in his nuclear ambitions.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38492947" class="story-body__link">In January, Kim Jong-un warned</a> that his military was close to testing long-range missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the United States mainland, but experts doubt the technology has progressed that far. </p><p>At the time, Mr Trump derided the claim in a tweet, saying: "It won't happen."</p><p>On a visit to South Korea last week, US Defence Secretary James Mattis said that any use of nuclear weapons by North Korea would be met with an "effective and overwhelming" response.</p>
