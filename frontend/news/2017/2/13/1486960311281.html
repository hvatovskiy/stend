    <div class=""><p>Over the last few years, North Korea has tested several ballistic missiles with a varying degree of success.</p>
<p>The leader of the country, Kim Jong-un, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/north-korea-long-range-missile-170101042104128.html" target="_blank">has promised</a> to continue the tests, drawing condemnation by South Korea, Japan and the United States.</p>
<p>North Korea is barred under UN resolutions from any use of ballistic missile technology but<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/north-korea-sanctions-declaration-war-160707195621342.html" target="_blank"> six sets of UN sanctions</a> since Pyongyang's first nuclear test in 2006 have failed to halt its drive for what it insists are defencive weapons.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/warns-north-korea-nuclear-attack-170203034440571.html" target="_blank">US fears</a> North Korea may one day use its missiles to deliver a nuclear payload to its west coast.</p>
<p>Analysts are divided over how close Pyongyang is to realising its <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/north-korea-earthquake-nuclear-test-160909031720481.html" target="_blank">full nuclear ambitions</a>, especially as it has never successfully test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).</p>
<p>The infographic below shows the maximum range of each of the ballistic missiles North Korea has tested over the last few years.</p></div>
