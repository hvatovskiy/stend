<p>Johnny Islam, 29, is from Leyton in east London. Although having TB in the brain is rare, the disease itself is not.  </p><p>Once deadly in the Victorian era - when it was known as the white plague - it is often assumed that tuberculosis has long since been eradicated. </p><p>But there are so many cases in London that the city is known as the TB capital of Western Europe. </p><p>Having the disease has changed Johnny's life. It could cause long-term damage, or even kill him.  </p><p>"I'm scared to go outside, I'm scared to do things on my own because I can blackout at any time. </p><p>"It can spread to any brain cells, it can damage your memory, and I forget things all the time.  </p><p>"Everyone is going to die one day. This disease could kill me, anything can happen." </p><p>The most recent data on infection rates show parts of London still have higher rates of TB than in some developing countries, such as Iraq, Libya and even Yemen. </p><p>It is a bacterial infection, which mainly affects the lungs, but can target any part of the body. It is curable in most cases. </p><p>TB in the lungs is spread through inhaling tiny droplets containing the bacteria, from the coughs or sneezes of someone infected with it. </p><p>Johnny's condition is rare and complex, and he's been taking a combination of 12 antibiotic tablets for more than a year.</p><p>He's involved in video observed treatment - which involves him recording himself taking his medicine on a smartphone, and then sending the recording on a secure server to his health care workers, so they know he's sticking to the treatment. </p><p>The first-ever trial of this method was carried out by University College London, in collaboration with University College London Hospitals. It saw patients recording themselves taking their medication daily using a dedicated smartphone.</p><p>They then employ a custom app allowing secure upload to an NHS-approved server, for remote viewing by a trained observer. </p><p>The trial's been described as a potential game-changer in the fight against tuberculosis in the UK. </p><p>The preliminary results show more than 80% of patients completed the treatment using the technology, which paves the way for it to be used in the most complicated cases, such as Johnny's. </p><p>Millions have been invested to try to eliminate TB as a public health problem.</p><p>There were 5,758 new cases of active TB in the UK, in 2015 - and almost 40% of those were in London.  </p><p>Recently there's been a fall in overall cases, but those involving the most at risk and difficult to treat, such as people who are homeless, abusing drugs or in prison, are rising.</p><p>Finding active cases is the first challenge - the next is getting them to stick to the long treatment, which involves a minimum of six months on a combination of antibiotics.  </p><p>Patients often stop midway, which can cause a relapse and strains of the bacteria to become resistant to drugs.</p><p>Experts hope the video-observed treatment might help with this.  </p><p>Dr Alistair Story was involved in the video trial and said that if it "works for TB, it works for other conditions".</p><p>"With the emergence of drug-resistant strains of bacteria, we think this has an important role to play to prevent the spread of the disease." </p><p>Johnny is now nearing the end of his treatment. </p><p>"I have so many side-effects from all the medicines I'm taking. I've been losing my hair, and my left leg stops working sometimes. </p><p>"It's been difficult to stick to the treatment, but I hope it's worked and I can finally be TB free."</p>
