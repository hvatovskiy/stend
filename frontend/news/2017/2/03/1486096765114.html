There are just under 28,500 US troops in the country, for which Seoul pays about $900m (Â£710m) annually.</p><p>President Donald Trump has previously said he wants both South Korea and Japan to pay more towards maintaining that presence. </p><p>Mr Mattis has been using his visit to reassure South Korea that the Trump administration "remains steadfast" in its "iron-clad" defence commitments to the region, said the Pentagon.</p><p>Speaking after talks at the defence ministry with his South Korean counterpart Han Min-koo, Mr Mattis told reporters that "any attack on the United States, or our allies, will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons would be met with a response that would be effective and overwhelming".</p><p>North Korea conducted its fifth test of a nuclear device last year, and claims it is capable of carrying out a nuclear attack on the US, though experts are still unconvinced its technology has progressed that far.</p><p>It has also said in recent weeks that it has a new intercontinental ballistic missile, capable of reaching the US mainland, which it is prepared to test launch at any time. </p><p><a href="/news/world-asia-pacific-11813699" class="story-body__link">How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme?</a></p><p><a href="/news/world-asia-17399847" class="story-body__link">North Korea's missile programme</a></p><p>Under the Obama administration, the US and South Korea agreed to deploy a US-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defence system in South Korea.</p><p>Its supporters say it is aimed solely at defending from North Korean threats. But China and Russia have complained it is unnecessary and provocative.</p><p>Beijing says it goes "far beyond the defence needs of the Korean peninsula".</p><p>It is also unpopular with some South Koreans, who fear missile bases could become targets and endanger people who live nearby.</p><p>Speaking on Thursday, Mr Mattis sought to reassure China, saying there is "no other nation that needs to be concerned about THAAD other than North Korea".</p><p>Mr Han said Mr Mattis's visit "communicates the strongest warning to North Korea".</p>
