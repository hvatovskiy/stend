<p>"I remember my father bringing in the grapes and putting them in a big clay vat," says California-based wine-maker Darioush Khaledi, recalling his childhood in pre-revolutionary Iran.</p><p>"I would climb on top and smell and enjoy the wine."</p><p>Darioush's family was from Shiraz, a fabled city in south-western Iran, whose name was once synonymous with viticulture and the poetry and culture of wine.</p><p>He remembers happy evenings when the family would gather, sipping wine from clay cups, and reciting lines from the 14th Century Persian poet Hafez. </p><p>"It wasn't just about drinking wine," he says. "It was an adventure." </p><p>The world Darioush remembers came to an end in 1979 when Iran's new Islamic rulers banned alcohol.</p><p>They shut down wineries, ripped up commercial vineyards and consigned to history a culture stretching back thousands of years.</p><p>An ancient clay jar has pride of place at the University of Pennsylvania museum in Philadelphia in the US.</p><p>It was one of six discovered by a team of American archaeologists at a site in the Zagros mountains in northern Iran in 1968.</p><p>The jars date back to the Neolithic period more than 7,000 years ago, and provide the first scientific proof of the ancient nature of Iranian wine production.</p><p>Chemical analysis on one of them revealed that a dark stain at the bottom was actually wine residue.</p><p>"This is the oldest chemically-identified wine jar in the world," says Prof Patrick McGovern.</p><p>The first evidence of grape cultivation in Shiraz came around 2,500 BC, when vines were brought down from the mountains to the plains of south-west Iran, the professor says.</p><p>By the 14th Century, Shiraz wine was immortalised in the poetry of Hafez, whose tomb in the city is still venerated today.</p><p>"Last night, the wise tavern master deciphered the enigma," he wrote. "Gazing at the lines traced in the cup of wine, he unravelled our awaiting fate."  </p><p>In the 1680s, a French diamond merchant, Jean Chardin, travelled to Persia to the court of Shah Abbas.</p><p>He attended elaborate banquets and recorded the first European account of what Shiraz wine actually tasted like. </p><p>"It was a very specific red," says French historian and Chardin expert Francis Richards. "It was a wine with good conservation because generally the local wines very quickly turned to vinegar."</p><p>But is there a connection between the "dark red wine that smells like musk" immortalised by Hafez, and the Shiraz wine drunk across the world today?</p><p>The first stop in my research is one of France's most famous vineyards in the Rhone valley in the south and home to the Syrah vine.</p><p>According to local legend, the Hermitage vineyard was founded by a 13th Century knight called Gaspard de Sterimberg, who brought back a Persian vine from the Crusades.</p><p>The names Syrah and Shiraz are often used interchangeably. Could Syrah be a corruption of Shiraz and prove a Persian connection?</p><p>The definitive answer came in 1998 when DNA testing was carried out on the local vines to pinpoint their origin.</p><p>"Some people think it comes from Persians and others from Sicily where you have Syracuse city," says grape geneticist Jose Vouillomoz. "But today we know all of that is wrong.</p><p>"Testing was done by two different labs," he continues. "And it was really a surprise to find out that Syrah is a natural spontaneous crossing between two local vines from this area."</p><p>So wherever the name came from, it seems there is no genetic connection between Syrah grapes and the wines of ancient Shiraz.</p><p>But the trail does not end there.</p><p>Outside of France, the biggest producer of Syrah in the world is Australia and the wine is always called Shiraz.</p><p>This can be traced back to a Scot called James Busby who exported Syrah vines from the Hermitage to Australia in the 19th Century. </p><p>His first consignment of vines was labelled "scyras" which many thought was a misspelling of Syrah. </p><p>But when I re-read his journal, I came across a line which proved he knew about the Hermitage Persian vine legend. </p><p>"According to the tradition of the neighbourhood," he wrote. "The plant - scyras - was originally brought from Shiraz in Persia."</p><p>At that time European wine-makers sometimes imported wine from Persia to add sweetness and body. </p><p>So perhaps Busby hoped the ancient name Shiraz would add some Persian mystique and flavour to his New World wine-making endeavour.</p><p>The United States imported Syrah vines in the 1970s and the wine is always marketed under the Syrah name - with one notable exception.</p><p>Darioush Khaledi, a son of Shiraz, is the proud owner of a 120-acre vineyard in California's Napa Valley producing what he insists on calling Shiraz wine. </p><p>"My French friends say Shiraz/Syrah comes from the Rhone and [has] a 500-year-old history," he says. "But if you open an atlas of the world there's only one place in the whole world called Shiraz and it has a 7,000-year-old history of wine growing."</p><p>He highlights his Iranian heritage in the vineyard. The entrance to the main building is lined with Persian-style columns reminiscent of the ancient city of Persepolis.</p><p>The day we visit, his marketing manager Dan de Polo is holding a wine tasting for a group of Chinese buyers.</p><p>"What's great about Shiraz is that it's always been a very soulful wine," he tells them.</p><p>Soulfulness, spirit and poetry - words that come up time and again when talking about Shiraz wine.</p><p>And for Darioush, and for me, I think that is what matters most. </p><p>It is not about the DNA of the grapes, it is about the link Shiraz offers us to the spirit of our faraway homeland and the romance of its fabled wine.</p><p>You can watch The Secret History of Shiraz Wine on BBC World at the following times:</p><p>Saturday 4 February - 09:10; 20:10</p>
