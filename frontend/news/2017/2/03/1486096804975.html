<p>The policy, which has a snap-back mechanism in case of mass violation of terms, was approved on Thursday with 553 votes in favour, 66 against and 28 abstentions.</p>
<p>The short-term travel visa waiver - expected to come into force in late March following formal approval by the European Council - applies to the Schengen area, which includes 26 countries.</p>
<p>Giorgi Kvirikashvili, the country's prime minister, called it "a truly historic day", expressing gratitude to the EU body.</p>
<p>He also said the government was convinced that Georgians would show "exceptional responsibility in accepting this milestone result and achievement, and will scrupulously observe the laws of host countries".</p>
<p>"Indeed, today marks Georgia's great success! Today's decision will prove that Georgia's policy on drawing closer to the European Union brings tangible results for every Georgian citizen," <span> Kvirikashvili </span>said on Twitter.</p>

<p>Georgia, with only 3.7 million citizens, will lose visa exemption for nine months if its citizens suddenly start making many more asylum requests; stay in the bloc for longer than 90 days at a time; or cause a "substantial increase in the risk to public policy or internal security".</p>
<p>If problems persists, the bloc would be able to extend the suspension for another 18 months in a more complex procedure that would also give the European Parliament a say.</p>

<p>Georgia sees visa-free travel to the EU as part of a geopolitical tussle with Russia over the ex-Soviet state's Western aspirations, which Moscow opposes.</p>
<p>The republic was at the heart of international tensions in 2008 when a five-day war between Tbilisi and Moscow in August led to the previous sharp decline in ties between Russia and the West.</p>
<p>The prospect of easier travel to Europe has been used by the pro-Western government in Tbilisi to win popular backing for painful EU-sponsored reforms.</p>
<p>The EU-Georgia talks on visa liberalisation started in June 2012.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
