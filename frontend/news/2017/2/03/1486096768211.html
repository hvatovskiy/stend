<p>The average annual comprehensive policy cost £462 in the last three months of 2016, according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI).</p><p>Previously the highest figure was £443 in the spring of 2012.</p><p>The rise comes in spite of government attempts to limit compensation payments and cut court costs.</p><p>One reason for the increase is a rise in the cost of repairing cars that have been in accidents, because of their increasingly sophisticated electronics.</p><p>Buying in spare parts is also getting more expensive, due to the weakness of sterling.</p><p>The average repair bill has risen by 32% over the last three years to £1,678, the ABI said.</p><p>The ABI warned that premiums were likely to increase further, if the government went ahead with plans to review the so-called discount rate.</p><p>When accident victims are given a lump sum in compensation, the sum is discounted to make up for the extra investment return they are likely to receive.</p><p>Since 2001 the discount rate has been 2.5% - based on investment returns from government bonds.</p><p>If that rate is reduced, insurance companies will have to pay out more - thus increasing premiums.</p><p>"The sudden decision to review the discount rate has the potential to turn a drama into a crisis, with a significant cut throwing fuel on the fire in terms of premiums," said Rob Cummings, the ABI's head of motor and liability.</p><p>The government said it would make an announcement as soon as possible.</p><p>"The Lord Chancellor has decided to review the discount rate to ensure personal injury claimants are fairly compensated," said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice.</p><p>"Due to ongoing consultation it is not yet possible to announce the review's outcome."</p><p>The cost of insurance has also risen because of a series of increases to Insurance Premium Tax (IPT).</p><p>IPT went up from 6% to 9.5% in 2015, to 10% in 2016, and will rise to 12% in June 2017.</p><p>Personal injury claims, such as whiplash, have also become more expensive, rising by 2.3% over the last year, the ABI said.</p><p>However, the government is currently <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38002662" class="story-body__link">consulting on plans</a> to cap compensation payments to accident victims, which it says could reduce annual premiums by £40 a year.</p>
