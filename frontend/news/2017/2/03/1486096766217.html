<p>The condition, misophonia, is far more than simply disliking noises such as nails being scraped down a blackboard. </p><p>"I feel there's a threat and get the urge to lash out - it's the fight or flight response," says patient Olana Tansley-Hancock, 29, from Kent.</p><p>UK scientists have shown some people's brains become hardwired to produce an "excessive" emotional response.</p><p>Olana developed the condition when she was eight years old. Her trigger sounds include breathing, eating and rustling noises.</p><p>She told BBC News: "Anyone eating crisps is always going to set me off, the rustle of the packet is enough to start a reaction.</p><p>"It's not a general annoyance, it's an immediate 'Oh my God, what is that sound?' I need to get away from it or stop it'.</p><p>"I spent a long time avoiding places like the cinema. I'd have to move carriages seven or eight times on 30-minute train journeys, and I left a job after three months as I spent more time crying and having panic attacks than working." </p><p>Scientists at multiple centres in the UK scanned the brains of 20 misophonic people, including Olana, and 22 people without the condition.</p><p>They were played a range of noises while they were in the MRI machine, including:</p><p>The results, published in the journal Current Biology, revealed the part of the brain that joins our senses with our emotions - the anterior insular cortex - was overly active in misophonia.</p><p>And it was wired up and connected to other parts of the brain differently in those with misophonia.</p><p>Dr Sukhbinder Kumar, from Newcastle University, told BBC News: "They are going into overdrive when they hear these sounds, but the activity was specific to the trigger sounds not the other two sounds.</p><p>"The reaction is anger mostly, it's not disgust, the dominating emotion is the anger - it looks like a normal response, but then it is going into overdrive."</p><p>There are no treatments, but Olana has developed coping mechanisms such as using ear plugs. </p><p>She also knows caffeine and alcohol make the condition worse, "which is rubbish".</p><p>"But I have a relatively mild case and am still able to have a job, I know a lot of people who aren't able to have that, I feel quite fortunately really," she said.</p><p>It is still not clear how common the disorder is, as there is no clear way of diagnosing it and it was only recently discovered. </p><p>Ultimately, the researchers hope, understanding the difference in the misophonic brain will lead to new treatments.</p><p>One idea is that low levels of targeted electricity passed through the skull, which is known to adjust brain function, could help.</p><p>Tim Griffiths, a professor of cognitive neurology at Newcastle University and University College London, said: "I hope this will reassure sufferers. </p><p>"I was part of the sceptical community myself until we saw patients in the clinic and understood how strikingly similar the features are. </p><p>"We now have evidence to establish the basis for the disorder through the differences in brain control mechanism in misophonia."</p><p>Follow James <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesTGallagher" class="story-body__link-external">on Twitter.</a></p>
