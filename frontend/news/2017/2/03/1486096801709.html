<p>Thursday's protest were among the biggest rallies in Romania since the end of communism in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Many shouted "Thieves!" and called on the government to resign.</p>
<p><span>Earlier, after a meeting in Bucharest of his ruling Social Democrats,</span> Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu said: "We took a decision in the government and we are going to press ahead."</p>
<p><span>His defiant remarks came after the country's business and trade minister resigned over the decree.</span></p>

<p>Passed late on Tuesday, the decree decriminalises certain corruption offences and makes abuse of power punishable by jail only if the sums involved exceed 44,000 euros ($47,500).</p>
<p>Florin Jianu, minister of business, trade and entrepreneurship, called his resignation an "ethical" decision.</p>
<p>"Not for my professional honesty, my conscience is clean on that front, but for my child," he wrote on Facebook.</p>
<p>"Am I going to tell him his father was a coward and supported actions he does not believe in, or that he chose to walk away from a story that isn't his?"</p>

<p>According to local media, more than 200,000 people continued the protest on Thursday in the capital and dozens of cities across the European Union state, where a crackdown on corruption over the past four years has uncovered myriad conflicts of interest and a pattern of local officials handing out state-funded contracts in exchange for bribes.</p>
<p>A day earlier, some 250,000 people protested, with the majority taking to Bucharest's streets to decry the decree.</p>
<p><span>The recent decree was adopted barely a month since the Social Democrat-led government of Grindeanu took power.</span></p>

<p>Romania's top judicial watchdog has filed a constitutional court challenge to the decree, which will take effect in 10 days unless blocked by a court ruling.</p>
<p>Grindeanu sent a letter on Wednesday to European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker explaining why his cabinet chose to pass the decree and a draft bill granting prison pardons for several offences.</p>
<p>The government said it was designed to ease prison overcrowding and bring the criminal code into line with recent constitutional court rulings.</p>

<p><span>Juncker on Wednesday said he was watching developments with "great concern", warning that the fight against corruption in Romania "needs to be advanced, not undone".</span></p>
<p>Six western states including Germany and the US have also criticised the government.</p>
<p>"The Social Democrats are testing how far they can go," Laura Stefan, an <span>anti-corruption legal expert s</span>aid. "If we accept they can approve emergency decrees untransparently, then tomorrow they will adopt others and so on. We will wake up without institutions overnight."</p>
