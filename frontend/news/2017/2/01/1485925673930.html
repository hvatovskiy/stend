<p>Javad Zarif affirmed his position on Tuesday, a day after White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the United States was "aware that Iran fired a missile" and was "looking into the exact nature of it".</p>
<p><span>Addressing reporters alongside his visiting French counterpart, Jean-Marc Ayrault, Zarif said: "The missile issue is not part of the nuclear deal."</span></p>
<p>Reiterating Iran's traditional stance, Zarif said that his country's missiles are "not designed for the capability of carrying a nuclear warhead".</p>
<p>Iran is only using ballistic missiles to defend itself, he added.</p>

<p>A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a ballistic missile test was carried out on Sunday from a site near Semnan, east of Tehran, according to the Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>The medium-range ballistic missile reportedly exploded after 1,010km, the official said, adding that the last time this type of test was test launched was in July 2016.</p>
<h2>Nuclear deal</h2>
<p>The reported test drew wide condemnation as many feared it could be in violation of a UN resolution adopted in 2015 prohibiting ballistic missile tests designed to deliver a nuclear warhead.</p>
<p>The resolution was part of the nuclear deal between Iran and the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany.</p>
<p>US Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he would work with politicians and President Donald Trump's administration to hold Iran accountable.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the European Union called on Tehran to "refrain from activities which deepen mistrust". EU foreign policy spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said that such a test was "inconsistent" with the UN resolution.</p>
<p>Israel also condemned the test.</p>
<p>During the US election campaign, Trump branded the nuclear agreement "the worst deal ever negotiated", telling voters that he would either rip it up or seek a better deal.</p>
<p>Speaking from Tehran, France's Ayrault voiced "concern" over the reported test.</p>

<p>"France has expressed its concern at Iran's continuation of its ballistic missile tests on several occasions," Ayrault said.</p>
<p>He said the continued tests are "contrary to the spirit" of the Security Council resolution.</p>
<p>But, he added: "We harbour real concerns about the US administration's attitude towards this agreement."</p>
<p><span>In a similar vein, Zarif said that he hoped Iran's defence programme "is not used by the new US administration ... as a pretext to create new tensions".</span></p>
<p>After an urgent UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday, called by Washington, the US envoy to the UN said the test was "absolutely unacceptable".</p>
<p>"We have confirmed that Iran did have a medium-size missile launch testing," said Nikki Haley.</p>
<p>"That is more than enough to be able to deliver a nuclear weapon," she sais, adding that the US "is not naive".</p>
<p>Al Jazeera's Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Iran's capital, Tehran, said Iranian officials insist that the country has complied with the restrictions imposed in the deal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russia said the test by Iran does not contravene the UN resolution.</p>
<p>"Such actions, if they took place, do not breach the resolution," <span>Sergei Ryabkov, the </span>Russian deputy foreign minister, told Interfax news agency, saying demands for UN talks were aimed at "heating up the situation".</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
