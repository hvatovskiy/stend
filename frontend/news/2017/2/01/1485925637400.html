<p>The British Heart Foundation said the figure was 100,000 more than had been thought and could be even higher. </p><p>It said there was now a better grasp of the prevalence of inherited conditions. </p><p>A child of someone with an inherited heart condition can have a 50% chance of inheriting it themselves. </p><p>The foundation warned that the overall figure for those with the faulty gene could be much higher because of as yet undiscovered faulty genes and under-diagnoses.</p><p>Each week in the UK, around 12 seemingly healthy people aged 35 or under are victims of sudden cardiac death with no explanation, largely due to undiagnosed heart conditions.  </p><p>The Birk family, from Hounslow, in west London, were tested for the faulty heart gene after Maninder Birk collapsed at home on his 16th birthday.</p><p>The results showed that Maninder, his younger brother Manvir and his mum Inderdeep all had the faulty gene hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). </p><p>Inderdeep said it was "completely devastating" to discover her sons had inherited it from her. </p><p>She says the heart condition has presented itself differently in each of them. </p><p>"Maninder had to give up a promising career in rugby, but is now leading a relatively normal life. But Manvir and I struggle day-to-day with our health. </p><p>"Manvir can't finish a whole day at school. He is constantly tired and his energy levels are very low. He is mainly home-schooled now as it is hard for him to keep up with his work.</p><p>"He also misses out on seeing his friends as he can't do the normal activities most 15-year-olds can do."</p><p>They have both had implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) fitted to prevent their hearts from stopping suddenly. </p><p>Research has helped to discover many of the faulty genes that cause inherited heart conditions. </p><p>This has led to the development of structured genetic testing services for those at highest risk for some of these conditions. </p><p>However, the British Heart Foundation says more research is urgently needed.</p><p>Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, BHF medical director, said: "The reality is that there are hundreds of thousands of people across the UK who are unaware that they could be at risk of sudden death.</p><p>"If undetected and untreated, inherited heart conditions can be deadly and they continue to devastate families, often by taking away loved ones without warning.</p>
