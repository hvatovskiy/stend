He had just been made redundant from his job in a car factory before a trial with the Gunners.</p><p>"The sales of Oscar, Dimitri Payet, Odion Ighalo and Memphis Depay, as well as around &pound;20m worth of sales to Championship clubs, have helped Premier League clubs record net receipts for the first time in a transfer window," said Deloitte spokesman Dan Jones.</p><p>"As was the case last year, it is clubs in the bottom half of the table who have driven expenditure this January, investing in their squads in an attempt to secure survival."</p><p><i>Andy Brassell, European football expert</i></p><p><b>Germany</b>  doesn't really get the last-minute English spirit of deadline day, with the Bundesliga wrapping things up at the civilised hour of 6pm local time as usual.
