<p>Reverend Rene Robert enshrined his opposition to the death penalty in a letter he wrote 22 years ago, in which he apparently foresaw his own killing.</p><p>The Catholic priest's note requested that whoever took his life be spared execution "no matter how heinous their crime or how much I may have suffered".</p><p>Bishops have petitioned the court to drop capital punishment in the case.</p><p>The body of 71-year-old Fr Robert, of St Augustine, Florida, was found riddled with bullets in woods in Georgia in April 2016.</p><p>Authorities say he was killed days earlier by a man, Steven Murray, whom he had been trying to help for months.</p><p>In 1995, the priest signed a "Declaration of Life" document, which was witnessed and notarised by a lawyer.</p><p>"I request that the person found guilty of homicide for my killing not be subject to or put in jeopardy of the death penalty under any circumstances," wrote Fr Robert.</p><p>The note had remained in his personnel file at his own insistence, said Catholic bishops, who are protesting against the prosecutor's decision to seek capital punishment for his killer.</p><p>Fr Robert devoted his life to helping society's most troubled people, including convicts and the mentally afflicted, say friends.</p><p>"He was well aware for the potential violence that might involve his ministry, but he cared for those people nonetheless," said Archbishop Wilton Gregory. </p><p>The archbishop was among about a dozen clergymen who rallied on Tuesday outside the court in Augusta, Georgia.</p><p>They delivered a petition by more than 7,400 people from Fr Robert's diocese asking that his wishes be honoured.</p><p>"We want to be the voice that he no longer has to make that 'Declaration of Life' a part of the understanding of this particular case," said Bishop Gregory Hartmayer outside court.</p><p>Bishop Felipe Estevez, of the St Augustine diocese, said the alleged killer clearly deserved punishment.</p><p>But, he added, "imposing a sentence of death as a consequence of killing only perpetrates the cycle of violence in our community".</p><p>The prosecutor, Augusta Judicial Circuit District Attorney Ashley Wright, has cited four aggravating factors in her decision to seek the death penalty if the accused is convicted.</p><p>She said these were that the slaying was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman.</p><p>Mr Murray, a repeat offender, had asked the priest for a lift in Jacksonville, Florida, before abducting and murdering him, authorities said.</p><p>The suspect was apprehended while driving the priest's blue Toyota Corolla in South Carolina a day after Fr Robert was reported missing. </p><p>Mr Murray led police to the priest's body.</p><p>During a court appearance shortly after his arrest, he appealed for forgiveness.</p><p>"If anybody loves Father Rene, they'll forgive me because he was a man of God, and forgiveness is forgiveness," the suspect said, according to Georgia's WALB News. </p>
