<p>Given the immense impact the US Supreme Court has on US political life, the nominee will face tough questions from the Senate during any confirmation hearings.</p><p>So how might this pick change the nation's high court?</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33103973" class="story-body__link">Who are the current justices? Meet the Supremes</a></p><p>The highest court in the US is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. </p><p>It hears fewer than 100 cases a year and the key announcements are made in June. Each of the nine justices serve a lifetime appointment after being nominated by the president and approved by the Senate.</p><p>Cases are usually brought to the court after they are appealed from a series of lower courts, although in time-sensitive cases, lawyers can petition for a hearing. The court's opinions can also create precedents, directing other judges to follow their interpretation in similar cases.</p><p>In recent years, the court has expanded gay marriage to all 50 states, halted President Obama's immigration orders and delayed a US plan to cut carbon emissions while appeals went forward.</p><p>Occasionally, the Supreme Court will revisit an issue in a new case and change their own precedent, a move anti-abortion activists hope will come to pass with a new conservative justice.</p><p>The court already has cases this term on the rights of<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37802223" class="story-body__link"> transgender students</a>, gerrymandered voting districts and on a Texas' death penalty determination.</p><p>It is also likely the court will hear cases on voter rights, abortion, racial bias in policing and in the legal system, as well as US immigration policy in the upcoming years. </p><p>Mr Trump's executive order on banning refugees and travellers from Muslim-majority nations may also end up on the Supreme Court's plate.</p><p>One of the defining moments of the US election campaign was the death of Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia. As I travelled across America, Republicans who didn't like Mr Trump's brashness, or his language towards women, told me they were prepared to overlook that for one reason:  Mr Trump's pledge to appoint a conservative judge to replace Scalia. </p><p>Donald Trump won big with evangelical Christians, who don't support abortion or gay marriage - issues the court has had a say on in the past. For them, changes under the Obama years such as increased LGBT rights were an affront to their core values. </p><p>Last week thousands of Trump supporters attended the March for Life, against abortion. As Vice-President Mike Pence addressed the crowds he told them they were "winning again". President Trump's Supreme Court pick represents more than a new justice on the bench, but a moment where conservative values could once again dominate the agenda in Washington DC. </p><p>While a majority of Supreme Court cases do not break on ideological lines, there are conservative and liberal wings. Key cases have been decided on 5-4 votes.</p><p>With Scalia's death, the court is arguably divided four-four. </p><p>Confirming a conservative justice with similar views to Scalia would ultimately return the court to a narrow conservative majority, but it would not guarantee wins on all the issues Mr Trump has described as a priority.</p><p>Justice Anthony Kennedy is considered the court's swing vote, having sided with both the conservative and liberal justices on major cases. </p><p>Liberals and legal advocates on the other side of these issues are also concerned about the potential for Mr Trump to nominate a second justice during his term.</p><p>In March, President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a federal appeals judge, for the empty seat. But Republicans refused to hold a hearing or vote on Mr Garland's nomination, and he is no longer under consideration.</p><p>During their year without a ninth justice, the court continued to work, with some cases affected by Scalia's death.</p><p>A 4-4 deadlock on Mr Obama's immigration order left the legal status of about four million undocumented immigrants in limbo. Public sector labour unions got a temporary win in another tied case, but  no precedent was set because of the split.</p><p>But the court also <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36598737" class="story-body__link">rejected a conservative challenge</a> to a university affirmation action policy in a 4-3 vote, after Justice Kagan recused herself. And justices voted 5-3 to strike down a pair of Texas abortion restriction laws.</p>
