<p>A brain-computer interface was used to read the thoughts of patients to answer basic yes-or-no questions.</p><p>One man was able to repeatedly refuse permission for his daughter to get married.</p><p>The study on four patients in Switzerland - <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002593" class="story-body__link-external">published in PLOS Biology</a> - also showed they were happy despite the effects of being "locked-in".</p><p>The patients all had advanced forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in which the brain loses the ability to control muscles.</p><p>It eventually traps people in their own body - they are able to think, but incapable of moving or talking.</p><p>When they become "locked in", it can still be possible to develop ways of communication using eye movements. </p><p>But all the patients in the study, at the Wyss Center in Switzerland, were "completely locked in" and could not even move their eyes.</p><p>The activity of brain cells can change oxygen levels in the blood, which in turn changes the colour of the blood.</p><p>And scientists were able to peer inside the brain using light to detect the blood's colour, through a technique called near-infrared spectroscopy.</p><p>They then asked the patients yes-or-no questions such as: "Your husband's name is Joachim?" to train a computer to interpret the brain signals.</p><p>The system achieved an accuracy of about 75%.</p><p>It means questions need to be asked repeatedly in order to be certain of a patient's answer.</p><p>Prof Ujwal Chaudhary, one of the researchers, told BBC News: "It makes a great difference to their quality of life.</p><p>"Imagine if you had no means of communicating and then you could say yes or no - it makes a huge impact."</p><p>In one case a daughter wanted the blessing of her completely locked-in father before marrying her boyfriend.</p><p>But eight times out of 10 the answer came back no.</p><p>"We don't know why he said no," said Prof Chaudhary.</p><p>"But they got marriedâ€¦ nothing can come between love."</p><p>The form of communication is being used for more practical day-to-day means such as finding out if patients are in pain or want a family visit. </p><p>Prof John Donoghue, the director of the Wyss Center, told the BBC: "If a person who is totally locked-in is able to communicate, you're freeing the mind to interact with the world around them.</p>
