<p>In 2010 Molly Forbes had her first child, Freya. But after the birth she was confronted with something she had not prepared for: loneliness.</p><p>A "sociable person", Molly - then 26 - was one of the first of her friends to have a baby. Her husband was out at work all day and she did not have any close family living by.</p><p>"The loneliness of being a new mother was a real surprise for me. It just hit me," she said. </p><p>"You're suddenly at home with a baby. You feel safer there so you stay home - but it makes you more isolated.</p><p>"When you go out, you want to be seen to be doing a good job and being happy. If you admit you're lonely, you might be labelled as not coping." </p><p>The commission - planned by West Yorkshire Labour MP Jo Cox before she was murdered last June - says a fifth of the population privately admit they are "always or often lonely". </p><p>But two-thirds of those would never confess to having a problem in public, it says</p><p>Molly, from Devon, said that rather than being honest about how she was feeling, she had "put a brave face on - and that can make you more lonely".</p><p>"Looking back, I was definitely feeling quite anxious. </p><p>"I was worrying about money, about whether I'd go back to my job - and when you don't have someone to talk to, these worries can spiral out of control."</p><p>Molly had lots of friends, but found she couldn't talk to them about her post-baby concerns. That was when she started writing a <a href="http://www.mothersalwaysright.com/" class="story-body__link-external">blog</a>. </p><p>"I made connections with other mums online, and from there I started meeting up with people and found friends that way."</p><p>The commission says three-quarters of people who are lonely on a regular basis do not know where to turn for support. It is looking for practical solutions to beat loneliness.</p><p>Molly's advice for new mums? </p><p>"Spend time making friends with other pregnant women, so you have a support network ready to go once the baby is born." </p><p><strong>Have you experienced loneliness?

I got myself so worked up and thought this is it. I can't do this," Michelle said. </p><p>"At one point I couldn't be left on my own at all, I wouldn't let [my parents] out the door."</p><p>Spending time out of the house and with friends can be key to countering loneliness but, Rossanna Trudgian, Head of Campaigns at Mencap explained, almost a third of youngsters with learning disabilities spend less than an hour outside their homes on a Saturday.</p><p>"Social isolation and fear of negative attitudes can remain huge barriers towards feeling welcome and included in society," she said.</p><p>But things have got better for Michelle. Talking things through with her family has helped - and this week, she starts a new course. </p><p>Michelle's advice is "talk". </p><p>She said: "If you keep it to yourself, you will bottle it up and build up more anxieties and won't go out."</p><p>Michelle is by no means the only young person experiencing loneliness.</p><p><a href="http://www.themix.org.uk/" class="story-body__link-external">The Mix</a> is an online support service for under-25s. This year, it has seen a 26% rise in the numbers of those accessing their loneliness support service, compared to the previous year. </p><p>Community manager James Pickstone said loneliness was "an underlying issue" shared by many people who visit the service, even though it was "rarely discussed openly". </p><p>He said: "We see a lot of young people feeling isolated at college and university, living away from home and not having the social life expected and associated with the university experience."</p><p>And younger people can experience loneliness differently from how older adults do.</p><p>Prof Graham Davey from the University of Sussex explained: "Younger people appear to be focused on friendship networks - the number of relationships they have - and experience loneliness as a function of the fewer friends they have."</p><p>And in today's society, friendship networks are represented nowhere more obviously than on social media.</p><p>"Whether you perceive yourself to be a successful user of social media is likely to have an impact on feelings of loneliness, anxiety, paranoia and mental health generally," the psychology professor said.</p>
