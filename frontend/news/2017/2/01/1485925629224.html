<p>If confirmed by the Senate, the 49-year-old would replace the vacancy left on the court by the late Justice Antonin Scalia. </p><p>The upper chamber's Democratic leader has already said he has "very serious doubts" about the nominee. </p><p>The court has the last legal word on many of the most sensitive US issues, from abortion to gender to gun control.</p><p>Mr Trump said Judge Gorsuch had a "superb intellect, an unparalleled legal education, and a commitment to interpreting the Constitution according to text".</p><p>"Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline, and has earned bipartisan support," Mr Trump added.</p><p>The announcement was made in the East Room of the White House in a primetime address on Tuesday evening.</p><p>In other developments:</p><p>Protests against Mr Trump's choice were held outside the Supreme Court following the announcement. </p><p>In accepting the nomination, Judge Gorsuch said: "I am honoured and I am humbled."</p><p>He was picked out of a shortlist of 21 possible choices that Mr Trump made public during the election campaign.</p><p>Donald Trump's choice of Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee is a fairly traditional pick in a decidedly untraditional time. </p><p>Judge Gorsuch has a CV and background that would make him a natural selection for just about any Republican president. </p><p>He's the kind of Supreme Court nominee evangelical and traditional conservative voters dreamed of as a reward for sticking with Mr Trump through the general election despite campaign missteps, controversies and occasional political apostasies. </p><p>They knew they would get a court pick they wouldn't like if Hillary Clinton won. They hoped they would get someone like Judge Gorsuch if Mr Trump prevailed.</p><p>Meanwhile, Democrats are left fuming over Senate Republicans' precedent-breaking decision to stymie Barack Obama's attempts to fill this court vacancy for nearly 10 months. </p><p>They have to decide if they will try to derail Mr Gorsuch's nomination as retribution - perhaps forcing Republicans to break with another Senate tradition, the ability of a minority to a block a Supreme Court nominee with only 41 votes through a filibuster.</p><p>The party's base, feeling a liberal majority on the court was stolen from them, will demand lockstep resistance, likely setting up a divisive confirmation fight ahead.</p><p>The Ivy-League educated jurist has the potential to restore the 5-4 conservative majority on the nine-seat high court.</p><p>The youngest Supreme Court pick in a quarter of a century, he is not expected to call into question high-profile rulings on abortion and gay marriage.</p><p>He is an "originalist", meaning he believes the US Constitution should be followed as the Founding Fathers intended. </p><p>However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer suggested Judge Gorsuch might be outside the legal mainstream. </p><p>"Given his record, I have very serious doubts about Judge Gorsuch's ability to meet this standard," Senator Schumer added.</p><p>But <a href="https://twitter.com/VP/status/826599863748018176" class="story-body__link-external">Vice-President Mike Pence tweeted</a> the nominee was "one of the most mainstream, respected, and exceptionally qualified Supreme Court nominees in American history". </p><p>Judge Gorsuch's nomination is expected to spark a political showdown in the Senate. </p><p>Former President Barack Obama had put forward Judge Merrick Garland after Justice Scalia's death last February.</p><p>But Republicans refused to debate the choice, saying it was too close to an election, which left Democrats embittered.</p><p>Even if Judge Gorsuch makes it through the Senate Judiciary Committee, he will still face challenges when the entire chamber convenes for a final vote.</p><p>Democrats may seek to prevent that second vote, by filibustering in order to deny Mr Trump the 60-vote threshold needed to bring the nomination to the floor.</p><p>With Republicans only holding 52 Senate seats, they may have to change Senate rules in order to approve Mr Trump's nominee.</p><p>The highest court in the US is often the ultimate arbiter on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions.</p><p>It hears fewer than 100 cases a year and the key announcements are made in June. </p><p>Each of the nine justices serves a lifetime appointment after being nominated by the president and approved by the Senate.</p><p>The court already has cases this term on the rights of transgender students, gerrymandered voting districts and on the Texas death penalty determination.</p>
