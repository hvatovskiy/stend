<p>"My city has turned to ruins," she says.</p><p>Despite being in constant danger, forced out of her home twice by shelling and living without regular supplies of electricity or water, this 22-year-old has refused to give up being a student.</p><p>Four years ago, she had just left school and begun at the University of Aleppo when it was hit by rockets, killing dozens of students around her.</p><p>"I saw my friends killed and still now I can't forget what happened," Mariam says.</p><p>"I saw a lot of students hurt and injured. There was blood, death. Everything was terrible."</p><p>There was intense danger at home too.</p><p>"I came so near to death many times," Mariam says.</p><p>"My family and I rented a house that was only 500m (0.3 miles) or so from the front lines, and a lot of rockets fell in my neighbourhood.</p><p>"Many of my neighbours were killed, and mortars hit my home twice."</p><p>She remembers waking during an attack, unable to see in the dust and darkness and not knowing who was alive or dead.</p><p>Mariam talks of life in Aleppo becoming a mix of "horror and danger".</p><p>"I was crying so much when I saw my city in front of my eyes, everything destroyed," she says.</p><p>But her reaction has been to stubbornly carry on and to use her studies as a way of honouring those who have died.</p><p>She became an online student in a warzone, following a degree course run by the US-based <a href="http://www.uopeople.edu" class="story-body__link-external">University of the People</a>, making a conscious decision to be "optimistic" and to make plans to "rebuild".</p><p>But this is far from straightforward, she says over a patchy Skype line.</p><p>"The hardest thing about being a student in Aleppo? Actually, it's being alive," Mariam says.</p><p>There are still occasional rockets and mortar blasts, despite a ceasefire, but there are also big practical problems that would have put off a less determined student.</p><p>"We haven't had electricity for two years," she says. </p><p>Instead, people rely on generators that might operate for a few hours at a time. </p><p>Mariam goes to a local shop with a small generator, where it can take 12 hours to charge up her mobile phone and an old laptop, and then she ekes out the charge so she can study.</p><p>Internet connections are sporadic and weak - and when an exam was approaching, there was an internet blackout.</p><p>Worried that she would be failed, Mariam began to make preparations to travel to Damascus to find a way of sitting the exam. </p><p>Even by the standards of a civil war, she says, this would have been extremely dangerous, but friends managed to make contact with the university, and she was able to re-arrange the exam.</p><p>Heat and light are daily challenges, particularly in winter, with temperatures in Aleppo below freezing this week. </p><p>Water is available only every three or four weeks. "When we have water, we store huge amounts," she says, filling every container.</p><p>There have been long battles between government and rebel armies in Aleppo, but there are also forces of the so-called Islamic State not far from the city.</p><p>Mariam says they tried to cut a road to the city a few days ago - but she says there is also the battle of ideas and the need to protect the right to education.</p><p>Their presence makes her even more determined to keep studying.</p><p>While the high technology of war has rained down on Syria, this young woman has to study at night by candlelight.</p><p>But she doesn't complain. Instead, she talks with understated longing for one single "normal day" as a student. </p><p>And what would she do with it?</p><p>"I want to do a lot of things in this day," she says.</p><p>"I want to go to my university like any normal student. </p><p>"I want to go with my friends.</p><p>"I want to sit with my family."</p><p>She pauses. "And I want to see everyone I lost," she says.</p><p>But in the face of such awful destruction, why is she worrying about getting a degree?</p><p>Mariam says the experience of war has made education seem even more important - something positive that links people to the chance of rebuilding a better life.</p><p>"We have this strong motivation to seek it no matter what," she says.</p><p>"You can see that in young children going to their schools, even though they can be hit at any time."</p><p>"Education was always important in my life.</p><p>"It gives me hope that I can have a better future. </p><p>"It will help me to rebuild my country and everything that's been destroyed."</p><p>Mariam is studying a business degree with the University of the People, based in California, which supports people around the world who otherwise would not have access to university - including 15 students in Aleppo.</p><p>The online university, backed by the likes of the Gates Foundation, Hewlett Packard and Google, offers accredited four-year degree courses, taught by volunteer academics and retired university staff.</p><p>The university's president, Shai Reshef, says: "We are an alternative for those who have no other alternative."</p><p>Mariam sees her studying as a kind of lifeline and source of hope - and she says any other students around the world should appreciate the chances they have.</p><p>She can only dream of having a "normal life like them".</p><p>"I hope that whoever sees my story will not be discouraged by difficulties they face," she says.</p><p>"I believe that after every hardship comes a great rebirth, and in honour of ever friend, neighbour and Syrian who lost his life due to this war, we must stay optimistic."</p><p>And if that faith wavers?</p>
