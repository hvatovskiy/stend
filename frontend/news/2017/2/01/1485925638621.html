<p>The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, says the 16 million fares currently on offer are "baffling" for passengers.</p><p>It wants to ensure passengers are offered the cheapest possible fares.</p><p>The trial from May will particularly benefit people travelling between Scotland and south-west England.</p><p>A traveller buying an off-peak return from Wick, in northern Scotland, to Par, in Cornwall, can currently pay up to £342.50, although in practice few people pay that amount.</p><p>However, by buying six separate fares for each leg of the journey, passengers can pay as little as £80 for the same trip.</p><p>The RDG says the potential saving of £262 will soon be offered to customers automatically.</p><p>CrossCountry Trains, an operator taking part in the trials, may eventually offer savings on other routes as well. </p><p>Passengers travelling between London and Glasgow, or London and Edinburgh, may also benefit from clearer pricing.</p><p>Operators currently have to offer a return fare between these cities, which is regulated by the government.</p><p>But the RDG says it would be more transparent - and possibly cheaper - for commuters if the single fares were regulated instead.</p><p>It wants more airline-style booking of single fares - at ticket offices and ticket machines, as well as on the internet.</p><p>"We're determined to overhaul the system to cut out red-tape, jargon and complication to make it easier for customers to buy fares they can trust, including from ticket machines," said Jacqueline Starr, RDG director of customer experience.</p><p>The trial will also see the removal of some historic fares which do not make sense.</p><p>At the moment passengers travelling between London St Pancras and Sheffield pay extra to travel via Grantham, for example, even though it takes longer.</p><p>Such fares date back to the pre-privatisation era of British Rail.</p><p>The price of average train fares - including regulated and unregulated tickets - went up by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38486011" class="story-body__link">2.3% in January</a>, even though consumer prices rose by just 1.6% last year.</p>
