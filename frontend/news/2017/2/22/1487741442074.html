<p>From Sydney and Los Angeles to Hong Kong, artist Joshua Smith's small models depict the buildings of big cities. Everything in them is reduced to scale, down to worn posters and discarded cigarette stubs. </p><p>This model is based on a building found on Willow Street, in the Tenderloin neighbourhood of San Francisco.</p><p>This shipping container was originally located in Haymarket in Sydney, before Smith shrunk it down to size.</p><p>This building is also based on one found in Sydney's Chinatown, and contains LED lights to keep it illuminated at night. Smith has even recreated the bin bags left on the street.</p>
