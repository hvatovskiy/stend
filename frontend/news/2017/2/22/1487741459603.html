<p>They order border patrol and immigration officers to deport as quickly as possible any undocumented immigrants they find, with only a few exceptions, principally children.</p>

<p><span>Although the priority for deportation will remain undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes, it will also include anyone who has been charged or potentially faces criminal charges.</span></p>
<p>In addition, categories of undocumented immigrants deemed as low priority by the previous Barack Obama administration, generally anyone not tied to a crime, are no longer protected.<br> <br>"With extremely limited exceptions, DHS will not exempt classes or categories of removal aliens from potential enforcement," the department said.<br> <br>"All of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to enforcement proceedings, up to and including removal from the United States."</p>
<p>Kelly said the mass detentions of the past, requiring judicial review, have overburdened the government.</p>

<p>"The surge of illegal immigration at the southern border has overwhelmed federal agencies and resources and has created a significant national security vulnerability to the United States," he said in one of the memos.</p>
<p>"Thousands of aliens apprehended at the border, placed in removal proceedings, and released from custody have absconded and failed to appear at their removal hearings. Immigration courts are experiencing a historic backlog of removal cases."</p>
<h2>The wall</h2>
<p>Kelly ordered immediate action to begin planning and building a wall along the US southern border with Mexico.<br> <br>He also ordered the hiring of another 5,000 officers for the Customs and Border Protection agency and 10,000 for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.</p>
