<p>But it is fair to say, no police officer expects that trouble to be related to the complexities of a 10-year-old's maths homework.</p><p>Yet when faced with just such an issue, one brave officer in Marion, Ohio, stepped up to the mark.</p><p>Lena Draper decided to use Facebook to get in touch with her local police force, sending them an appeal for help at the weekend.</p><p>"I am having trouble with my homework. Could you help me?" she asked.</p><p>"What's up?" asked officer BJ Gruber, who told the BBC he was hoping "for something in the realm of history".</p><p>Unfortunately for him it was maths, with the added complication of a few brackets.</p><p>Undeterred, Lt Gruber threw himself into the challenge.</p><p>"I felt pretty confident with my answers on both questions and perhaps that worked against me with the second equation," Lt Gruber admitted. </p><p>Indeed, more than a few people have pointed out the answer he gave to the second, more complicated question, was incorrect - but the Police Department in Marion, Ohio, are still seeing the episode as a win.</p><p>"We are nailing our goals of increasing trust, transparency &amp; being approachable. Still a work in product on the math skills," the force wrote on its Twitter page after Lena's mum Molly uploaded screenshots of the conversation to Facebook.</p><p>The post has now been liked more than 2,300 times.</p><p>"We really hope that are are not flooded with homework requests... so far, so good," Lt Gruber said. </p><p>"We really see this not different that a child walking up to an officer on the street and asking for help. This is just a 21st Century version of that interaction. We do however encourage kids to communicate with parents, teachers, siblings and fellow students before asking us."</p><p>As for Lena, she knows she can't always rely on the police to help her with her homework. But she does have a backup plan.</p>
