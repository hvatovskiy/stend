<p>Milo Yiannopoulos is a passionate supporter of Donald Trump and rose to fame as an editor at the right-wing website Breitbart. His extreme views on feminism and Islam made him a darling of the American alt-right - a loose collection of anti-immigration, anti-political correctness conservatives including many white nationalists. Although Yiannopoulos has consistently said he is not a member of the movement, in March 2016 co-wrote a much-cited <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/29/an-establishment-conservatives-guide-to-the-alt-right/" class="story-body__link-external">defence of the alt-right</a>.</p><p>But now he appears to have crossed a line with his views after videos surfaced in which he appeared to condone paedophilia, and some of his former allies have turned against him.</p><p>The footage showed him discussing the merits of gay relationships between adults and boys as young as 13. Yiannopoulos will no longer speak at a US conservative conference and a book deal, reportedly worth $250,000, has been cancelled. </p><p>On Tuesday he <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39043496" class="story-body__link">resigned from Breitbart</a>. In a statement he said his "poor choice of words" was detracting from the work of his colleagues.</p><p>While many grass-root supporters are standing by him, a number of high profile right-wing figures seem to have decided his latest comments are a step too far.</p><p>Tim Treadstone tweets under the name Baked Alaska and ranked number eight on Time Magazine's most influential Twitter feeds of 2017. He was one of the first alt-right activists to openly criticise Milo.</p><p>Gavin McInnes, a co-founder of Vice Media and now a leading anti-feminist campaigner, was also quick to distance himself from Milo's comments, but at the same time claimed that the Breitbart editor was being targeted by establishment forces.</p><p>"Advocating sex w 13-yr-olds under ANY conditions is indefensible but this is ultimately about the old right's disdain for the new right," he tweeted.</p><p><a href="/news/world-us-canada-39026870" class="story-body__link">Who is Milo Yiannopoulos?</a></p><p><a href="/news/world-us-canada-39043496" class="story-body__link">Yiannopoulos quits Breitbart News</a></p><p><a href="/news/magazine-37021991" class="story-body__link">Trump’s shock troops: Who are the ‘alt-right’?</a></p><p>Visit the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCTrending/" class="story-body__link-external">Trending Facebook page</a></p><p>The white nationalist Richard B Spencer, one of the leaders of the movement and someone who had previously described Yiannopoulos as "alt light" was dismissive.</p><p>Yiannopoulos did though get support from some parts of the far right. Alex Jones, who runs the far right Infowars, uploaded a video defending Yiannopoulos, blaming the mainstream media for taking his words out of context.</p><p>Debate has also been raging on the social media site Gab, which <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-38305402" class="story-body__link">as BBC Trending has previously reported</a>, is a favourite hangout of the alt-right. Users seem divided over whether Yiannopoulos deserves sympathy or condemnation. </p><p>"Yes, Milo is a flamboyant provocateur, but this coordinated attack on him by the #FakeNews is disgusting," wrote <a href="https://gab.ai/RobertCornero" class="story-body__link-external">one user</a> who signed off with the hashtag "Stand with Milo."</p><p>Another wrote: "Please let's not lose this guy. Nothing is worse than serving a cause, and getting chewed up and spit out." </p><p>While most of the messages on Gab defended Yiannopoulos, many users were critical: "Regardless if recent events are justified or not, I haven't liked that many were hitching the movement to Milo. He's always been a bit of an attention whore." </p><p>"Milo has always insisted he isn't #altright, he recently disavowed white identity and on Maher said he wasn't even conservative," wrote another. "He basically disavowed the entire right so what are we defending here exactly?" </p><p><i>Blog by Will Yates</i></p><p><strong>Next story: </strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-39041596" class="story-body__link">The mystery of the anti-UKIP Twitter machine</a></p><p><i>Why is a strange network of Twitter accounts, usually the source of pro-Russian messages, now pumping out tweets about a very specific British election?</i><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-39041596" class="story-body__link">READ MORE</a></p>
