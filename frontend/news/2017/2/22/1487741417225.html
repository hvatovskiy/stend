<p>As of 2012, Britons must earn more than £18,600 before a husband or wife from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) can settle in the UK.</p><p>Critics claim 15,000 children have been separated from parents because of it.</p><p>The rule was introduced by the former coalition government to stop foreign spouses becoming reliant on taxpayers.</p><p>If the government loses, thousands of couples who currently live outside the UK could move to Britain.</p><p>The minimum income threshold, which also affects people settled in the UK as refugees, rises to £22,400 if they have a child who does not have British citizenship - and then by an additional £2,400 for each subsequent child.</p><p>These thresholds replaced a previous, more general requirement to show the Home Office that the incoming partner would not be a drain on public resources and that the couple or family could adequately support themselves. </p><p>The current rules do not take into account the earnings of the overseas partner - even if they have higher qualifications, or are likely to be employed in higher-paid work than their British spouse. </p><p>The minimum income threshold does not apply to spouses from within the EEA.</p><p>In a series of test cases, affected couples argued that the rules breached their right to family life. </p><p>Two of the claimants, Abdul Majid and Shabana Javed, are British citizens who have partners who are Pakistani nationals. </p><p>The third claimant is a Lebanese refugee who cannot find suitable work in the UK despite his postgraduate qualifications. He says his similarly-qualified wife has high earning potential and speaks fluent English. </p><p>The final case concerns another recognised refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo whose wife has been barred from settling. </p><p>In 2013, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23198144" class="story-body__link">the High Court ruled in the couples' favour saying that the rules were "onerous and unjustified"</a> - and the judge urged the home secretary to rewrite them. </p><p>That decision was overturned at the Court of Appeal, leading to the challenge reaching the Supreme Court. </p><p>If the Supreme Court rules against the government, it could lead to the minimum income threshold being lowered or, potentially, require Parliament to reconsider the entire law. </p><p>When the government introduced the measures, it said they aimed to reduce the burden on taxpayers, promote integration and prevent and tackle abuse of the family migration route.</p><p>But campaigners say that all they have done is split up couples and families for whom the minimum income threshold is unobtainable. </p>
