<p>To qualify for an auto-enrolment pension, workers have to earn at least £10,000 a year.</p><p>But more than 100,000 people - most of them women - do not reach that threshold, because they work for several employers.</p><p>The government said that it is planning to review the issue later this year.</p><p>A separate study shows that women still receive far smaller pensions than men.</p><p>According to the insurance company Zurich, the average woman will have £47,000 less in her pension pot than a man by the time she retires.</p><p>Citizens Advice said that 72,000 women were missing out on auto-enrolment pensions, which require employers to pay a pension automatically, unless a worker deliberately opts out.</p><p>The charity said too many people were being shut out of the opportunity to be paid a pension.</p><p>"Many people - particularly women - work several part time jobs, which helps them manage commitments like childcare or study," said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice.</p><p>"But while in many cases they earn over £10,000, and pay tax on this combined income, they don't have access to a workplace pension and miss out on the opportunity to save for their retirement."</p><p>The government said <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/review-of-automatic-enrolment-to-build-on-success" class="story-body__link-external">in December</a> that it would examine the issue of workers with multiple jobs when it reviews the auto-enrolment programme later this year.</p><p>"There's more to do - especially for people with more than one job - and we're currently reviewing the policy to see how it can be improved," a spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said.</p><p>The Zurich analysis found that between 2013 and 2016 men received 7.8% of their salary in pension contributions on average, compared to women receiving 7%.</p><p>It said men tend to work in sectors with more established or generous pension schemes.</p><p>In addition, women are more likely to take career breaks.</p><p>"This difference in the contributions that they receive from their employer presents a serious - and growing - problem," said Rose St Louis, Zurich's head of partnership development.</p>
