<p>In the photo, Mevlut Mert Altintas shouted after <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/russian-ambassador-andrey-karlov-shot-ankara-161219162430858.html">shooting Andrei Karlov</a> at an art gallery in Ankara, Turkey, on December 19, last year.</p>

<p><span>Ozbilici's winning photo was part of a series titled "An Assassination in Turkey" which also won the Spot News - Stories category, which he captured in the moments before and after Altintas, an off-duty policeman, drew a handgun and shot Karlov at the photo exhibition.</span></p>

<p>Ozbilici, talking to Al Jazeera from Amsterdam on Monday, said that he did his job by taking the photos, "standing for independent journalism".</p>
<p>"I immediately understood that it was a very important, historical moment. I had to stand there as a journalist and do my work," he said.</p>
<p>"It was extremely difficult for me to predict what he [the attacker] would do next after shooting the ambassador. And I was not sure if there were more attackers," Ozbilici said.</p>
<p>"I am not sure what I would do next in a similar situation [if it happened to me again]. I cannot predict. But I wish this does not happen to anyone else anywhere."</p>

<p>During the incident, the gunman shouted <span>"Don't forget Aleppo. Don't forget </span><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/syria.html">Syria</a><span>!" </span>in Turkish, referring to the Syrian city where Russian bombardments had helped to drive rebels from areas they had occupied for years during the war. </p>
<p>Authorities would later confirm that Karlov, 62, was dead. Altintas was killed after a 15-minute shootout.</p>
<p>The exhibition, titled "From Kaliningrad to Kamchatka, from the eyes of travellers" featured photos from Russia's westernmost Baltic region to the Kamchatka Peninsula, in the east.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
