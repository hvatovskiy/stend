<p>His resignation on Tuesday followed reports a day earlier that the Justice Department warned the Trump administration weeks ago that such communications could leave him in a compromised position.</p>
<p><span>It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy.</span></p>
<p><span>"Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador," <span>Flynn wrote in his official resignation letter.</span></span></p>
<p>"I am tendering my resignation, honored to have served President Trump, who in just three weeks has reoriented American foreign policy in fundamental ways to restore America's leadership position in the world," he added.</p>
<p>Retired General Keith Kellogg, who has been chief of staff of the White House National Security Council, was named the acting national security adviser while Trump determines who should fill the position.</p>
<h2>Discussing sanctions</h2>
<p>Flynn's departure less than one month into the Trump administration marks an extraordinarily early shakeup in the president's senior team of advisers.</p>
<p>Flynn was a loyal Trump supporter throughout the campaign, but his ties to Russia caused concern among other senior aides.</p>
<p>Flynn initially told Trump advisers that he did not discuss sanctions with <span>Russia's ambassador to the United States, <span>Sergey Kislyak,</span></span> during the transition.</p>
<p>Vice President Mike Pence, apparently relying on information from Flynn, publicly vouched for the national security adviser.</p>
<p>Flynn later told White House officials that he may have discussed sanctions with the ambassador.</p>
<p><span>His conversations raise questions about Trump's friendly posture toward Russia after US intelligence agencies concluded that Moscow hacked Democratic emails during the election.</span></p>
<p>A US official on Monday told The Associated Press that Flynn was in frequent contact with Kislyak on the day the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/expels-35-russian-diplomats-cyber-attacks-161229192854580.html">Obama administration slapped sanctions on Russia</a> for the election-related hacking, as well as at other times during the transition.</p>
<p>Flynn's discussions with the Russian raised questions about whether he offered assurances about the incoming administration's new approach.</p>
<p>Such conversations would breach diplomatic protocol and possibly violate the Logan Act, a law aimed at keeping citizens from conducting diplomacy.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
