<p>Most of the passengers - senior citizens returning from a day trip to a popular cherry blossom viewing site - were trapped underneath the crushed vehicle on an exit ramp in the Nangang district of eastern Taipei, state media said on Monday.</p>
<p><span>R</span>escue personnel used a crane to pry the vehicle open.</p>
<p><span>"It happened on a curve, so the bus flipped and that could be due to excess speed," said Tu Bing-cheng, a Taipei city official.</span></p>
<p><span>"The whole frame of the bus changed shape, got crushed and left no openings."</span></p>
