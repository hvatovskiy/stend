<p>The move was announced by Playboy's new chief creative officer Cooper Hefner, who said the decision to remove nudity entirely "was a mistake".</p><p>"Today we're taking our identity back and reclaiming who we are," <a href="https://twitter.com/cooperhefner?lang=en-gb" class="story-body__link-external">he tweeted.</a></p><p>The US magazine also promoted its March-April edition with a picture of its playmate of the month with the hashtag #NakedIsNormal.</p><p>Some social media users welcomed the U-turn, describing it as a "good call", while others said the decision was taken "because the magazines weren't selling too well. Too bad free porn is still easy to access".</p><p>On Monday, Mr Hefner wrote: "I'll be the first to admit that the way in which the magazine portrayed nudity was dated.</p><p>"Nudity was never the problem because nudity isn't a problem," added the 25-year-old son of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner.</p><p><a href="/news/world-us-canada-34514035" class="story-body__link">Playboy: Were no nudes good news?</a></p><p>Samir Husni, a journalism professor at the University of Mississippi, said Playboy's ban on nudity had probably alienated more readers than it attracted.</p><p>"Playboy and the idea of non-nudity is sort of an oxymoron," he told the Associated Press.</p><p>The magazine still had to find a way to appeal to a younger audience in a digital age where nudity has become commonplace, Mr Husni added.</p><p>In next month's issue, the magazine will also revive some of its old franchises, including The Playboy Philosophy and Party Jokes.</p><p>It also features an essay by actress Scarlett Byrne about the Free the Nipple campaign - a movement that started in the US to change laws around breastfeeding in public and female toplessness.</p><p>Byrne writes "about the importance of owning female sexuality and the double standards that still exist between women and men", the magazine says.</p><p>However, Playboy will drop the subtitle Entertainment for Men from its covers.</p><p>"Playboy will always be a lifestyle brand focused on men's interests, but as gender roles continue to evolve in society, so will we," Mr Hefner said.</p><p>Playboy, which was founded in 1953, stopped printing nude photos in March 2016. </p><p>Its US owners said at the time that he internet had made nudity outdated, and pornographic magazines were no longer so commercially viable. </p><p>Playboy's circulation has dropped from its peak 5.6 million in the 1970s to below 700,000 last year.</p><p>However, the magazine's logo showing a rabbit head wearing a bow tie is one of the most recognisable in the world. </p>
