<p><span>After coming out of one of the worst droughts this country has seen in over 25 years, strong thunderstorms proved deadly this past weekend.</span></p>
<p><span>Heavy rain caused major flooding in the area around Santa Cruz. Accumulations of over 75 millimetres were recorded in the city of Viru-Viru in just a few hours.</span></p>
<p><span>Along with the heavy rain the storms also produced massive amounts of hail that looked more like snow in some places.</span></p>
<p><span>At least two people have died due to the severe weather that hit the country late Friday night into Saturday morning.</span></p>
<p><span>Strong storms also impacted Bolivia last month during the Dakar Rally.</span><span>  </span><span>Several legs of the annual race had to be cancelled when storms caused some roads to become impassable because of flooding and landslides.</span></p>
<p><span>More rain is forecast this coming week for Bolivia with the northern and northeastern part of the country at risk for more flooding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
