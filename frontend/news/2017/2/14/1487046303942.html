<p>After decades of hosting Afghan refugees, the Pakistani government says it is making them leave because they pose a security threat.</p>
<p>Around 600,000 have moved back to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Pakistani government policy has been criticised by rights groups for months.</p>
<p>Now, Human Rights Watch is going after the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), accusing it of complicity in the alleged abuse.</p>
<p>What is behind the mass forced return? And how is Afghanistan dealing with the influx?</p>
