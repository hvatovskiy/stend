<p><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/korea-declares-ballistic-missile-test-success-170213085718539.html">Sunday's launch</a> of the Pukguksong-2 missile violated UN resolutions banning ballistic missile launches and marked a major escalation from Pyongyang's shorter-range rocket launches.</p>
<p>It was also the first direct challenge to the international community since US President Donald Trump took office on January 20.</p>
<p>"The members of the Security Council deplore all the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ballistic missile activities, including these launches," it said in a statement.</p>
<p><span><span>The council</span> </span>"called upon all member states to redouble their efforts to implement fully the measures imposed on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by the Security Council".</p>
<p><span>North Korea has been under UN sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. </span></p>
<p>In December, the council adopted a resolution aimed to slash North Korea's exports of coal and other metal exports, designed to cost it $800m a year.</p>

<p>The US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, had tough words for North Korea after the Security Council meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>"It is time to hold North Korea accountable - not with our words, but with our actions," Haley said in a statement.</p>
<p>At a news conference on Monday, Trump said: "Obviously North Korea is a big, big problem and we will deal with that very strongly."</p>
<p>The US "reaffirmed its ironclad security commitments" to South Korea and Japan, the Pentagon said.</p>
<p>Later on Monday, the South Korean defence ministry said the US and South Korea would deploy US strategic assets during their annual joint exercise - in what appeared to be a response to the missile launch.</p>
