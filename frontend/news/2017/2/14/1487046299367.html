They will take inspiration from their title-winning team of 2011-12 when they clawed back the same deficit on rivals Manchester United - on that occasion with just six games remaining.</p><p>This time they have 13 games in which to do it as former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss Guardiola looks to win a top-flight domestic title for the seventh time in the past eight seasons.</p><p>The Spaniard's pacy wingers were the difference on this occasion, as Sane's fleet-footedness set up Sterling for his sixth league goal of the season, before the England forward showed superb trickery to beat a defender and force Mings into a costly mistake, after pressure from Aguero.</p><p>The Argentine, who failed to start for the third consecutive game, was sent on after Jesus turned his ankle in the opening minutes.</p><p><i>Former Chelsea striker Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 live</i></p><p>"I don't think City can catch Chelsea. It's too big a gap with Chelsea performing as they have done, but it was a comfortable performance - they are brilliant going forward.</p><p>"I thought John Stones was outstanding and David Silva majestic. Since being thrashed 4-0 by Everton in January they have responded superbly. Things are coming together for City at the right time."</p><p>Eddie Howe's men have big problems. They have not won a game in 2017, extending their winless run in all competitions to seven games.</p><p>Their main worry is in defence, having conceded at least two goals in each of their last 10 games, yet at the other end they tested Caballero just once in this game.</p><p>To make matters worse, the Cherries have picked up just one win from their last nine games and had midfielder Jack Wilshere and defender Simon Francis go off injured in the first half.</p><p>In their second ever season in the top-flight, Bournemouth are 14th in the table, six points above the relegation zone. With Swansea and Hull showing improvement, the south coast side could get dragged into a fight for survival should their poor form continue.</p><p><b>Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe: </b>"City were very good. For an away team that was a very controlled performance. Our lads gave absolutely everything, I can't ask any more of them. </p><p>"We need to get our bounce back - that's only going to come from a win, but I think today was a positive step."</p><p><b>Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Sport:</b> "We made a real performance. I am so pleased with how we did and especially the last 10-15 minutes, we did the right way to make the result with a thousand million passes.
