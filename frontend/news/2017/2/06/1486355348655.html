<p>Inside Out London sent CVs from two candidates, "Adam" and "Mohamed", who had identical skills and experience, in response to 100 job opportunities.</p><p>Adam was offered 12 interviews, while Mohamed was offered four.</p><p>Although the results were based on a small sample size, they tally with the findings of previous academic studies.</p><p>These have found British Muslims are less proportionately represented in managerial and professional occupations than any other religious group. </p><p>The fake candidates applied for 100 jobs as business managers in the competitive field of advertising sales in London.</p><p>After two and a half months, Adam was offered three times more interviews than Mohamed. </p><p>The two CVs were also uploaded to four job sites. Adam was contacted by five recruiters, but Mohamed only two.</p><p>Prof Tariq Modood from the University of Bristol analysed the BBC's findings.</p><p>He said: "What we've identified very clearly is that the Muslim-sounding person's CV is only likely to get an interview in one out of three cases.</p><p>"I thought the response rate would be more like perhaps, one in three, but it's two in three so it's worse than I thought, especially in a city like London.</p><p>"It's so diverse, people coming in and out of the city, from different parts of the world, looking for work, a city very hungry for talent. Yes, it's worse than I thought."</p><p><strong>'I used the name John Smith'</strong></p><p>Yogesh Khrishna Dav√©, 56, is the director for quality at a pharmaceutical company in Slough. It has taken him decades to reach this senior role.</p><p>During the journey up the ladder he suspected he was being consistently overlooked for jobs because of his name. So he secretly carried out his own experiment. </p><p>"I entered the job market in the 80s. I put my CV in and it was disappointing. I got rejection letters.</p><p>"Someone suggested: 'Why don't you put a very English name on your CV [as well as sending one in your own name]... and see who they might offer the job to?' So I had my name, Yogesh, and John Smith. John Smith got the interview. I got rejected for the interview." </p><p>Muslim men are 76% less likely to be employed than their white Christian counterparts, according to research by the Research Centre for the Study of Ethnicity and Citizenship at the University of Bristol.  </p><p>The last census in 2011 showed Muslims make up just over 1 million of the capital's 8.2 million inhabitants. But more than half of Muslim households are in poverty, higher than any other social group, according to the <a href="https://www.mcb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MCBCensusReport_2015.pdf" class="story-body__link-external">Muslim Council of Britain</a>. </p><p>Prof Modood recalled how he was asked to use a different name at work when he was younger.</p><p>"I had a student job where the employer looked at my name and said 'Oh, that won't do, introduce yourself as Terry Miles' or something like that. I was very unhappy to do so.</p><p>"I wouldn't willingly change my name, and I've given my daughters Pakistani or Muslim names, even when I thought: 'Might this hurt their chances when they look for work?'" </p><p>Previous studies have shown an employment bias.</p><p>A field <a href="http://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/20541/test-for-racial-discrimination.pdf" class="story-body__link-external">experiment</a> for the Department for Work and Pensions in 2009 found ethnic minority applicants were discriminated against in favour of white applicants in 29% of cases.  </p><p>In 2015, a <a href="https://www.demos.co.uk/project/rising-to-the-top/" class="story-body__link-external">report</a> by the charity Demos found British Muslims were less proportionately represented in managerial and professional occupations than any other religious group. </p><p>Khalil Ur Rahman, an unemployed chartered surveyor, said: "I'm in between jobs at the moment. It's quite clear that it's not my qualifications or skill set that is the issue. It is my religion.</p><p>"I have seen many people who are less skilled than me but have risen up into more senior management positions, much faster and much quicker because their face fits." </p><p>He has taken legal action over what he sees as discrimination. </p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34636464" class="story-body__link">What is name-blind recruitment?</a></p><p>Barrister Nabila Mallick represents Muslims taking this kind of action against employers. </p><p>She said: "There's a perception of Muslim employees being considered disloyal, considered to be political, their appearances sometimes are read as them being fundamentalist. </p><p>"And it's leading to a significant number of Muslim employees being discriminated against."</p><p>She believes prejudice against Muslims in the job market has escalated dramatically in the past 15 years and is prone to fluctuation depending on world events.</p><p>President Donald Trump's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38783512" class="story-body__link">executive order</a> barring migrants and refugees from several Muslim countries is the latest example, she said.</p><p>Miss Mallick said: "I have no doubt there will be managers who will feel encouraged to discriminate in the recruitment of Muslims and to either continue with a policy or implement policies that discriminate against employees' right to pray in the workplace."   </p><p>In 2015, then prime minister David Cameron <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-time-to-end-discrimination-and-finish-the-fight-for-real-equality" class="story-body__link-external">announced</a> that Ucas, the UK's university admissions service, would use "name-blind" applications from 2017, meaning applicants' names would be removed. </p><p>He said the same would apply for graduate, apprentice-level and some other applications for organisations including the civil service, BBC, NHS, local government, KPMG and HSBC.</p><p>While in November 2015 the civil service introduced name-blind applications for all roles below senior civil service level, Ucas has not yet introduced them. But <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/510994/Talent_Action_Plan_2016.pdf" class="story-body__link-external">some trials</a> will take place as part of this year's enrolment.</p><p>Jonny Gifford from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said name-blind recruitment was a "really obvious thing for all employers to be doing where possible".</p><p>He added: "It's clear it makes a difference to the numbers of people from minority groups, in particular for ethnic minorities, who get a chance of getting an interview.</p><p>"It's also a really easy thing to implement. There's no real reason to not be doing this."</p>
