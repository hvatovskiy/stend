<p>With a television audience of 110 million, it's one of the biggest platforms in the world - and Gaga has been putting in the hours to ensure her set is suitably spectacular.</p><p>"We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show," she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5.</p><p>"And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."</p><p>She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career.</p><p>Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years.</p><p>Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. </p><p>Not Michael Jackson.</p><p>After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. <i>Ninety.</i></p><p>It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing.</p><p>Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. </p><p>Beat that, Gaga.</p><p>Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. </p><p>In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: "Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mike… BOOM! </p><p>"And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up and… BLAM! BORN TO RUN!"</p><p>It led to the memorable headline: "America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds.</p><p>Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. </p><p>She <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9cUytejf1k" class="story-body__link-external">only performed one song</a>, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement.</p><p>Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring "Justice 4 Mario Woods" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier.</p><p>The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.</p><p>You can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX.</p><p>She raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic.</p><p>For the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers.</p><p>1987's show was altogether more bizarre.</p><p>A magician named "Elvis Presto" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics.</p><p>At the culmination of the show, the "Prince of Prestidigitation" performed an interactive magic trick ("pick a card, concentrate real hard") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses.</p><p>It was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach.</p><p>She arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous "left shark".</p><p>He was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves. </p><p>It quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star.</p><p>And when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend. </p><p>Poor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob.</p><p>Few ever believed that the "wardrobe malfunction" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press).</p><p>Nonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered.</p><p>But there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online. </p><p>In response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content. That site would end up being YouTube. </p>
