<p>Around 460 suspects, most of them foreign nationals, were arrested during operations in at least 18 provinces, state-run <span>Anadolu news agency reported on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>At least 60 people were held in the capital, Ankara, while 150 were arrested in Sanliurfa in the southeast <span>and a further 47 in the nearby city of Gaziantep close to the Syrian border. </span></p>

<p>In the Aegean province of Izmir, security forces held at least nine suspected ISIL members who were allegedly preparing for an attack.</p>
<p class="selectionshareable">Another 18 people were arrested in Istanbul and the neighbouring province of Kocaeli on suspicion of planning attacks. Fourteen foreigners, including 10 children, were due to be deported.</p>

<p>"This is the largest coordinated and simultaneous raids that Turkey has taken out on what it says 'suspected members of ISIL' across the country," <span>Al Jazeera's </span><span>Stefanie Dekker</span><span>, reporting from Gaziantep</span><span>, </span><span>said. </span></p>
<p>"From what we understand, all of these raids took place around the same time at dawn on Sunday," she continued, adding that the operation signalled Turkey's clear intentions to give a "message that it is clamping down" on the armed group.</p>
<p>"Turkey has suffered multiple attacks either claimed by ISIL or inspired by it," Dekker said.</p>
<p class="selectionshareable">The Turkish government holds ISIL, which stands for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and is also known as ISIS, responsible for several attacks in Turkey. </p>
<p>Most recently, ISIL claimed responsibility for a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/scores-dead-attack-istanbul-nightclub-170101003450788.html">New Year's Eve attack</a> on the Reina nightclub in Istanbul in which 39 people were killed.</p>
<p>Police <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/istanbul-police-arrest-year-nightclub-shooter-170116213535554.html">detained</a> the suspected attacker, Abdulgadir Masharipov, an Uzbek national, on January 16  and authorities say he has confessed to the massacre.</p>
<p>Turkish troops are also engaged in battles against ISIL fighters in the Syrian town of al-Bab, in the fiercest fighting yet of Ankara's military's campaign inside Syria that started in August.</p>
<p>At least 48 Turkish soldiers have been killed in the incursion so far, according to an AFP news agency tally.</p>
