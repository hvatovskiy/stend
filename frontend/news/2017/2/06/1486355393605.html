<p dir="ltr">And years of conflict have made the stealing raids even more dangerous, with young raiders using guns and machetes.  </p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Local organisations say more than 5,000 civilians have been killed in cattle raids since South Sudan gained its independence in 2011.</span></p>

<p>The violence has seen villages destroyed, women abducted and lives lost.</p>
<p>"Our children are being killed," Rebeca Apien, a villager, told Al Jazeera. "We used to live in cattle camps with our children but now we're losing them because of the raids."</p>
<p><span>With a population estimated to be more than the number of civilians in the country, cows are considered a walking wealth, especially among herding communities. </span></p>
<p>Organisations expect the raids to increase with the approach of the dry season.</p>
<p><span>The government says it is trying to stop the violence, but acknowledges that it is struggling.</span></p>
<p>Since most of the cattle communities are located in remote areas, interventions are often hindered by access and the threat of firearms. </p>
<p dir="ltr">"The number of firearms being owned by the communities or the civilians is more than the number of firearms we have," Major General Nichola Dimo, Rumbek police commissioner, said.</p>
