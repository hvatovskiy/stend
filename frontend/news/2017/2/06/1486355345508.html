The courts are making the job very difficult!"</p><p>"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!"</p><p>The president earlier called Judge Robart's ruling "ridiculous", described him as a "so-called judge".</p><p>In its appeal, the Justice Department said Judge Robart had overreached by "second guessing" the president on a national security matter.</p><p>It also argued that only the president could decide who can enter or stay in the US.</p><p>The two states challenging the restriction - Washington and Minnesota - argued that the ban was unconstitutional and denied people with valid entry documents the right to travel without due process.</p><p>It also violated freedom of religion rights by appearing to target Muslims, they said.</p><p>The next step is for briefs to be filed by both sides for a formal review of Judge Robart's suspension on Monday. The Justice Department could have appealed directly to the Supreme Court on an emergency basis, but it chose not to since the appeal court is moving fairly quickly.</p><p>If the appeal court decides the stay is valid - perhaps as early as next week - then a Supreme Court appeal is almost certain.</p><p>In the meantime, everything is on hold. US immigration processes continue as they did before Mr Trump issued his executive order. </p><p>If it looks like this is bogging down, the president might eventually decide to modify the order rather than try to defend its legality. That's probably the most prudent course, but he's a stubborn man.</p><p>Democrats and some Republicans have criticised Mr Trump's comments about the country's judiciary.</p><p>Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Mr Trump seemed "intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis".</p><p>Meanwhile, Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell told CNN it was "best to avoid criticising judges individually".</p><p>Judge Robart has served on the federal bench since 2004 after nomination by President George W Bush.</p><p>Friday's ruling has also seen visa holders from the affected nations scramble to get flights to the US, fearing they have a slim window to enter.</p><p>The State Department has been reversing visa cancellations and US homeland security employees have been told by their department to comply with the ruling.</p>
