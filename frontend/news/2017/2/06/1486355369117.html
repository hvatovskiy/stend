<p>The Foxes are just one point above the relegation zone following <a href="/sport/football/38786544">Sunday's 3-0 defeat</a> at home to Manchester United.</p><p>Leicester are yet to win a league game in 2017 and have not scored in their previous five league outings.</p><p>"We're the reigning champions but quite frankly it's been terrible," Schmeichel told Sky Sports.</p><p>"Every player is hurting. It's not a situation that is comfortable. It's time for everyone to stand up and be counted because if we don't we're going to end up getting relegated."</p><p>This time last year, Leicester won 3-1 at Manchester City to move five points clear at the top of the table and put them on course for an unexpected title.</p><p>Now they are 38 points behind leaders Chelsea with <a class="sp-story-body__external-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/feb/03/claudio-ranieri-unrest-leicester-city-players-staff">reports suggesting<i class="sp-story-body__external-link-icon gelicon gelicon--external" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> manager Claudio Ranieri has lost the support of his players. </p><p>Schemeichel would not comment on the speculation but Ranieri insisted his squad is behind him.</p><p>"We're together. I'm happy with the players and they're happy with me. We have to stay together and keep fighting," he said.</p><p>Leicester full-back Christian Fuchs said the players must start to show more fight if they are to pull away from trouble.</p><p>"We keep our heads high, we have to fight as a team and give everything until the last game," he said.</p><p>"We have to stick together. We are not there to stick our head in the sand, we want to fight back."</p><p>Former England international Jermaine Jenas, speaking on Match of the Day 2, said: "Watching the game against Manchester United, it was not a great performance, but I didn't see players downing tools, or players that had completely given up on a manager.</p><p>"I saw players low on confidence and not given much direction of where to play.</p><p>"In the stadium there seemed to be no atmosphere and the longer that continues, the more they will be in trouble."</p><p>Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho had sympathy for his counterpart's predicament.</p><p>Mourinho was sacked by Chelsea in December 2015, just seven months after winning the Premier League, and the Portuguese coach said Ranieri deserves respect for his achievement at Leicester.</p><p>"For many years people will remember what he did," he said.</p><p>"They are finding it difficult. But we know their strength well. I'm sure they will get enough points to stay in the league."</p><p>Ex-England defender Phil Neville, speaking on Match of the Day's Facebook Live, said: "As much as last season was an absolute fairytale, they have got to get that out of their heads quickly because they are in a relegation battle. </p><p>"Everyone kept telling me of the qualities of Leicester last season but I have not seen any of that - the hard work, discipline. </p><p>"They must have been wracking their brains but what they have got to do is shape up. Ranieri has to take some of the blame and find a system that will get them results."</p><p>Jenas added: "If Ranieri hadn't won the league last season he would have gone. He is in a tough spell. The fact the club are sticking with him is the right decision." </p><p>Neville added on Match of the Day 2: "With the fixtures they have got coming up, you can't see where their next three points are coming from.</p><p>"In the next eight games, if they pick up one win, they will be lucky and that's why I think they're in serious trouble.</p>
