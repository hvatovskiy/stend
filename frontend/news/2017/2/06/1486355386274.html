<p>Heavy artillery fire, a car bomb explosion and other ceasefire violations coincided with a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart.</p>
<p>The two leaders discussed how to mend relations between the US and Russia.</p>
<p>US senators and analysts are wondering whether the surge in fighting is the Kremlin testing the water with the new US president.</p>
<p>Ukrainian government leaders and pro-Russia separatist rebels are blaming each other for the ceasefire violations.</p>
<p>Trump phoned Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and promised to restore peace.</p>
<p>But between commitments to support the Ukrainian leadership in Kiev and improving relations with Putin, it remains to be seen what Trump will do.</p>
<p>So, will he be able to restore calm in Ukraine?</p>
