<p>Kyle Edmund had just broken serve to lead 6-3 6-4 2-1 when frustration got the better of Shapovalov.</p><p>A default followed, giving Britain a 3-2 victory in the World Group first-round tie in Ottawa.</p><p>Britain go on to face France away in the quarter-finals in April.</p><p>"It was a strange way to finish," said Edmund. "I've never been part of something like that."</p><p>GB captain Leon Smith added: "A bit of a surprise what happened at the end there and I feel for the young lad. He's a great talent and he's learned a harsh lesson today."</p><p>Vasek Pospisil had earlier levelled the tie at 2-2 with a 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 3-6 7-6 (7-5) win over Dan Evans that lasted three hours and 23 minutes.</p><p>After the dramatic build-up provided by the fourth rubber, the decisive fifth looked to be heading for a relatively low-key conclusion as Edmund raced into a commanding lead.</p><p>Again, Britain had the advantage in terms of rankings, but Edmund also had five years and a growing bank of ATP experience on his side against the current Wimbledon junior champion, making his Davis Cup debut.</p><p>Shapovalov played much of the match in confident style, hammering down big serves and hitting flashing one-handed backhands, but his lack of experience showed with a handful of loose games.</p><p>With serve dominating, Edmund bullied the teenager with his forehand to earn the first two break points in game eight and Shapovalov offered up a double fault.</p><p>Edmund sealed the set with an ace out and wide, and repeated the formula in the second set - profiting from his opponent's errors to break at 5-4 and convert the set with another ace.</p><p>When Shapovalov framed a forehand wide to fall behind in the third set, there appeared little chance of a comeback, but that opportunity disappeared altogether when he angrily hit the ball off court.</p><p>It struck umpire Arnaud Gabas, giving the Frenchman a bruised eye, and after discussion with the team captains and match referee Brian Earley, the crowd were told that the tie was over as a distraught Shapovalov sat in his chair.</p><p>Canada's Davis Cup captain Martin Laurendeau said: "There's always a lesson to be learned from the good moments and the worst moments. If he wants to compete at this level he has to keep it together. </p><p>"Emotional control is the biggest factor in this game. He must learn the lesson and hope it serves him in the rest of his career."</p><p><b><i>John Lloyd, former Great Britain Davis Cup captain and player</i></b></p><p>Kyle Edmund has won this match but you don't want to win like this - it's a shocking way for it to finish.</p><p>This has taken a lot of gloss off for Kyle Edmund but he was going to win this match anyway. The incident looked worse the second time you saw it.</p><p>It was meant to go out of the stands, but Shapovalov got it completely wrong.</p><p><b><i>Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent</i></b></p><p>Umpire Arnaud Gabas was taken to Ottawa General Hospital for a check-up suffering from bruising and swelling of his left eye. Shapovalov made an impressive apology: he spoke of his shame and embarrassment and promised he will never do anything like that again.</p><p>He struck the ball with a serious amount of force. It was reckless and will live with him, but hopefully there will be no long term effect on Gabas' ability to umpire matches.</p>
