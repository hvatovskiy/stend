<p>Ms Conway said Mr Obama brought in a six-month ban on Iraqis after the arrest of "the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre".</p><p>"Most people don't know that because it didn't get covered," she added.</p><p>In fact, there was no massacre at Bowling Green, Kentucky.</p><p>Ms Conway, whose official role is counsellor to the president, <a href="https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/827505588808667136" class="story-body__link-external">later tweeted that she meant to say</a> "Bowling Green terrorists". </p><p>She made her remarks during an interview with MSNBC television, in which she defended Donald Trump's ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries.</p><p>"President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee programme after two Iraqis came here to this country were radicalised, and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre," she said.</p><p>In 2011, Barack Obama's administration brought in enhanced security measures for Iraqis after two men were arrested on terror charges - but there was never a formal ban in place.</p><p>It came after Iraqi natives Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21255696" class="story-body__link">were arrested on charges of attempting to send weapons and money to Iraq to support al-Qaeda there</a>. They also admitted using homemade bombs against US troops when they lived in Iraq.</p><p>The pair lived in Bowling Green, Kentucky - but were never accused of planning or attempting to carry out an attack in the US. Both are still in prison.</p><p>"Bowling Green Massacre" began to trend on Twitter following the interview, as users ridiculed Ms Conway's error in tributes to the fictional people who lost their lives in a massacre which did not happen.</p><p>She also recently made headlines for coining the term "alternative facts" when defending President Trump's White House.</p><p>In his first briefing, incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer gave attendance figures on Mr Trump's inauguration which contradicted photographic evidence - and were quickly denounced in many US news outlets as "falsehoods" and "lies". Ms Conway later said Mr Spicer had been presenting "alternative facts".</p>
