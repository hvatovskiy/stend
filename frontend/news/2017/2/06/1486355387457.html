<p>Last Monday, the AU approved <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/morocco-rejoins-african-union-33-years-170131084926023.html">Morocco's re-entry</a> into the bloc which it quit in 1984 in protest at the admission of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) declared by the Polisario Front at the height of a war for the territory.</p>
<p>"Not only does Morocco not recognise - and will never recognise - this so-called entity," Bourita told website Le Desk in an interview on Sunday.</p>
<p>"It will (also) redouble its efforts so the small minority of countries, particularly African, which recognise it, change their positions."</p>
<p>AU membership would not change Morocco's stance that the Western Sahara is an integral part of its territory, he said.</p>

<p>Monday's summit in Addis Ababa followed an intense diplomatic battle with the Polisario's backers, led by Algeria and South Africa, which opposed Morocco rejoining the AU.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the head of Western Sahara's Polisario Front has said "all options are open" in its independence struggle from Morocco, but called for talks after the kingdom rejoined the African Union.</p>
<p>Polisario head and SADR president Brahim Ghali told AFP in an interview on Sunday that the move did not fundamentally change the situation.</p>
<p>"We always look for the peaceful way" to resolve the conflict, Ghali told AFP at a Sahrawi refugee camp in Tindouf, southwestern Algeria.</p>
<p>"But all options remain open," he said, hinting that a return to armed struggle was possible.</p>

<p>Thousands of Sahrawis are settled in five camps around Tindouf, where they receive aid from UN agencies and international NGOs.</p>
<p>Efforts to reach a negotiated solution for the territory have borne little fruit.</p>
<p>Ghali, who took over as leader of the Algeria-backed Polisario on the death of his predecessor Mohamed Abdelaziz in May 2016, said he hoped new UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres will push for a return to talks.</p>
<p>"We hope that he will have the necessary support of the Security Council to lead the negotiations that will enable the self-determination of our people," Ghali said.</p>
<p>A UN peacekeeping force, MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara), was set up in 1991 to monitor the ceasefire and organise a poll on the future of the territory.</p>
<p>The SADR, which remains a member of the AU, demands independence and a UN-supervised referendum to resolve the conflict.</p>
<p>Morocco, which controls 90 percent of the territory including its three main towns, insists it is an integral part of the kingdom and that only autonomy is on the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span>Â <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
