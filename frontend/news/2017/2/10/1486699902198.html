<p>About 300 have already died at Farewell Spit, on the South Island, in one of the worst such cases in the country.</p><p>Hundreds of locals and conservation department staff have been trying to save the survivors since early Friday morning, and have formed a human chain to refloat the whales.</p><p>Scientists do not know what exactly causes whales to beach themselves. </p><p>But it sometimes happens because the whales are old and sick, injured, or make navigational errors particularly along gentle sloping beaches.</p><p>Sometimes when one whale is beached, it will send out a distress signal attracting other members of its pod, who then also get stranded by a receding tide.</p><p>The conservation department said it had received a report about a possible stranding on Thursday night, but did not launch the rescue operation until Friday morning as it was too dangerous to attempt a rescue in the dark, reported the <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11798305" class="story-body__link-external">New Zealand Herald.</a></p><p>Andrew Lamason, the departments regional manager, said it was one of the largest mass beachings recorded in New Zealand.</p><p>New Zealand marine mammal charity <a href="http://www.projectjonah.org.nz/Stranded+dolphins++whales/Why+Whales+Strand.html" class="story-body__link-external">Project Jonah.</a> which is leading efforts to save the whales said a total of 416 whales were stranded.</p><p>It said the surviving whales are "being kept cool, calm and comfortable" by medics and members of the public.</p><p>Some of the refloated whales tried to swim back to shore, and the human chain was trying to herd them out to deeper waters, said volunteer Ana Wiles.</p><p>She told <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/news/89283675/volunteers-at-farewell-spit-whale-stranding-one-of-the-saddest-things" class="story-body__link-external">news outlet Stuff</a> that there were "so many fins in the air, no breathing".</p><p>"We managed to float quite a few whales off and there were an awful lot of dead ones in the shallows so it was really, really sad."</p><p>"One of the nicest things was we managed to float off a couple [of whales] and they had babies and the babies were following," Ms Wiles added.</p><p>New Zealand has one of the highest stranding rates in the world, with about 300 dolphins and whales ending up on beaches every year, according to <a href="http://www.projectjonah.org.nz/Stranded+dolphins++whales/Why+Whales+Strand.html" class="story-body__link-external">Project Jonah.</a>.</p><p>Many of these incidents happen at Farewell Spit.
