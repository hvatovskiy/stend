<p><span><span>Hussein, an Egyptian who lives in Qatar, was stopped, questioned and detained by the Egyptian authorities on December 20 after travelling to Cairo for a holiday.</span></span></p>
<p>He has said that he suffers constant mistreatment in detention, that he is being denied his legal rights, that he is being kept in an individual cell and that he is being denied enough food and clothing.</p>
<p><span>Human rights and media organisations have </span><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/groups-call-release-al-jazeera-mahmoud-hussein-170104144554342.html">denounced his detention.</a></p>
<p>Al Jazeera has demanded that Egypt unconditionally release Hussein and condemned a court order that <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/egypt-extends-mahmoud-hussein-detention-45-days-170205115716453.html">extended his imprisonment for 45 days</a>.</p>
<p>His detention has been extended four times so far, with the latest order issued on February 5.</p>

<p><span>"Journalism is not a crime," Al Jazeera Media Network said on Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span> "T</span><span>he network condemns arresting and harassing journalists for simply doing their professional work ... Free press and freedom of expression are fundamental to democracy."</span></p>
<h2><strong>International law broken</strong></h2>
<p>Hussein faces a fabricated allegation of "disseminating false news and receiving monetary funds from foreign authorities in order to defame the state's reputation."</p>
<p>Al Jazeera has rejected all the allegations against him and condemned those who forced him into false "confessions" made on video.</p>
<p>The network said it holds the Egyptian authorities responsible for his safety and well-being.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera also denounced a smear campaign against Hussein, which is being carried through local media outlets - a practice that violates international law.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera</span></p>
