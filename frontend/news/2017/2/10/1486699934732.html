<p>El Nadeem Centre for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence and Torture in Cairo was shut on Thursday.</p>
<p>"About 15 policemen in official uniform with a group of civilians sealed three apartments in the building belonging to El Nadeem," Aida Seif el-Dawla, a co-founder of the nongovernmental organisation, told AFP news agency by phone.</p>
<p>"We didn't violate any rules and the government has not provided any reasons for its closure decision."</p>
<p>Seif el-Dawla said the centre had filed a lawsuit against the order.</p>

<p><span>A policeman said the centre had been closed for violating the terms of its licence, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media.</span></p>
<p>Authorities have tried on two separate occasions to shut down El Nadeem Centre amid accusations by human rights groups that the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is stifling civil society groups.</p>
<p>Rights campaigners accuse the authorities of human rights violations, including forced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and illegal detentions.</p>
<p>Seif el-Dawla was banned from travelling to Tunisia on November 23, along with several other rights activists and lawyers who are not allowed to leave the country.</p>
<h2>Strict NGO law</h2>
<p>Egyptian and foreign NGOs operating in the country are governed by a strict law which allows the government to supervise their activities and finances.</p>
<p>In November, authorities froze El Nadeem's assets for a week before the organisation submitted a document "proving" the centre is not subject to the law, El Nadeem said.</p>
<p>The organisation was registered with the health ministry and the doctors' union as a "medical clinic", Suzan Fayad, an El Nadeem co-founder, said.</p>
<p>Egypt's parliament approved in November a new law to regulate the activities of NGOs, in a move that prompted fears of an intensified crackdown on such groups.</p>
