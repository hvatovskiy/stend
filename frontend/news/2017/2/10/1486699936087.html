<p>Florin Iordache's resignation on Thursday came as rallies calling for the government to resign continued despite the Social Democratic-led leadership's pledge to scrap the decree, which would have decriminalised some corruption offences.</p>
<p>"I have decided to offer my resignation," said Iordache, 56, a co-architect of the January emergency rule which critics say would have protected corrupt politicians from prosecution.</p>

<p><span>He defended his record at the justice ministry saying he carried out "all necessary actions to remedy a series of sensitive problems".</span></p>
<p>"But despite that, public opinion did not consider it sufficient, and that's why I have decided to submit my resignation."</p>
<p>Iordache said all of his "initiatives were legal and constitutional".</p>
<p>Against this turbulent backdrop, Sorin Grindeanu, Romania's prime minister, survived a no-confidence vote on Wednesday despite the ongoing protests.</p>

<p>Bowing to pressure, the government scrapped the ordinance on Sunday as up to 500,000 people protested across the country.</p>
<p>The rallies were the largest protests since the fall of communist rule in 1989.</p>
<p>In a related development on Thursday, Romania's constitutional court said it would not rule on the decree.</p>
<p><span>The decree was referred to the court by Victor Ciorbea, the n</span><span>ational ombudsman,</span><span> on February 3, two days before the Social Democrats withdrew it.</span></p>

<p><span>"This decree does not exist anymore. It was scrapped [by the government]," said Valer Dorneanu, the court president.</span></p>
<p>"We start from the truth that the emergency decree no longer exists."</p>
<p>The withdrawal must still be approved by parliament.</p>
<p>Asked what would happen if parliament does not do so, Dorneanu said: "We don't judge based on suppositions."</p>
