    <div class=""><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Public opposition to further immigration from nationals of Muslim-majority countries is not limited to the US, research from Chatham House reveals.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a survey carried out in 2016, before US President Donald Trump's discriminatory travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, at least 10,000 Europeans were asked whether they agreed with the idea of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2017/02/media-muslims-trump-travel-ban-170204091307786.html">banning citizens</a> from Muslim-majority countries from entering their countries.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Poland, where the Muslim population is just 0.3, 71 percent said they supported such a ban. Austria, Hungary, Belgium and France followed, with 65, 64, 64 and 61 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"There is evidence to suggest that <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/02/trump-muslim-ban-exception-history-170209115112220.html">both Trump</a> and these radical right-wing parties reflect an underlying reservoir of public support," said Chatham House.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> "It is also worth noting that in most of these states [where agreement is high] the radical right is, to varying degrees, entrenched as a political force and is looking to mobilise this angst over Islam into the ballot box, either at elections in 2017 or longer term."</span></p></div>
