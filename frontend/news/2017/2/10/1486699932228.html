<p>The order calls on Toledo to be placed under "preventative custody" for 18 months, while demanding for his "immediate location, capture and confinement."</p>
<p>Toledo, who is believed to be in the French capital, Paris, has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>"Say when, how and where and in what bank they've given me $20m," Toledo said in an interview with a local radio station over the weekend.</p>
<h2>Multi-national scandal</h2>
<p>Odebrecht, once Latin America's biggest construction company, has admitted to paying almost $800m in bribes to governments across the region as part of a December plea agreement with the US justice department.</p>
<p>In Peru, the company acknowledged paying $29m for projects built during the government of Toledo and two successors.</p>
<p>Toledo, a former World Bank economist, served as Peru's president from 2001 to 2006.</p>
<p>In 2010 he sought the presidency anew but failed to make it to the second round of voting.</p>
<p>The scandal also threatens to implicate Toledo's successors: Alan Garcia and Ollanta Humala.</p>
<p>Garcia has denied any wrongdoing in recent weeks as authorities have arrested several accused of taking bribes from Odebrecht during his 2006-2011 government.</p>
<p>Aside from Peru, several countries in Latin America, including Panama, Mexico, Argentina and Uruguay, are carrying out investigations into bribes paid by Odebrecht.</p>
<p>In Panama, a former personal adviser to President Juan Carlos Varela on Thursday said on his former boss had accepted campaign donations from Odebrecht.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
