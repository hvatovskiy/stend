<p>In May last year, the A&amp;E department at Queen's Hospital, Romford, Essex, started a six-week trial to divert patients away from the department. </p><p>Patients that attended A&amp;E would be seen as soon as they walked into the department by either a consultant or a GP. </p><p>"The doctors would review them, and if appropriate they would redirect them to a more appropriate setting," says Sarah Tedford, chief operating officer at Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust. </p><p>"For a lot of patients that actually meant self care - so these were patients who, with the right reassurance, could actually manage the condition themselves."</p><p>Alternatively, patients would be redirected to a pharmacist or to their GP so they could get an appointment for a later date. </p><p>The trial worked so well that it has been adopted full time. </p><p>They currently divert between 60 and 90 patients a day. </p><p>"Most of them can be seen and assessed within five minutes," instead of potentially waiting for hours, Sarah Tedford says.    </p><p>She says the staff and most patients have taken to it "very well" and they have have been asked to go and talk to other hospitals about it. </p><p>"It's just really important to stress it's about directing patients to the most appropriate setting rather than waiting in a busy emergency department where they don't actually need to be," she says.</p><p>"It's about reassuring the public - it's not turning away sick patients, that's absolutely not what it's about."</p><p>In Glasgow, older patients have been helped to leave hospital thanks to a programme that opened 90 beds in private nursing homes.</p><p>Discharge policies were changed so that patients could leave hospital within 72 hours, and their long-term needs could be assessed outside hospital, rather than lying in a hospital bed.</p><p>The intermediate care programme, as it is called, was set up in 2014 by Glasgow City Council and NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde.</p><p>David Williams, the chief officer for Glasgow City Health and Social Care Partnership, says they asked the care home providers to work with them to "look at re-enablement and rehabilitating" the people placed in the homes. </p><p>"We set targets to get 30% of people home that came into intermediate care beds, and we have achieved that consistently," he says.</p><p>Beforehand, those people would probably have ended up going into residential nursing care for the rest of their days, he adds.</p><p>Now, moving patients out of hospital beds more quickly has helped the system to flow.</p><p>In 2015, Glasgow was the only part of the UK where A&amp;E waiting times were actually better than they were 12 months before.</p><p>Last week, figures showed there were only 24 patients aged over 65 who had been delayed leaving hospital. That compares with 140 people in 2014.</p><p>In the Wirral, a community diabetes clinic is reaching patients who can't travel or don't want to come to hospital.</p><p>These are the people that Dr King Sun Leong, a consultant in diabetes, worries about.</p><p>He set up the clinic in November 2015, because he wanted to get access to patients earlier to try to stop type-2 diabetes from taking hold, which can lead to heart attacks, strokes and other health issues.</p><p>Working with a GP and a specialist nurse, Dr Leong monitors patients' diets and lifestyle, talks to them about their work and their social life and how they lead their lives.</p><p>He also gives them advice and treatment with the aim of preventing future complications.</p><p>"If you've got a little hole in your roof, you want to stop it turning into a big hole," Dr Leong says, explaining why it's crucial to see patients early on in the community.</p><p>And they've had good results. </p><p>With two community diabetes clinics now in the Wirral, more nurses are being trained to deal with the care of type-2 diabetes and more people are being helped to avoid long-term health problems.</p><p>Patients visiting GPs in Rotherham are not just offered the normal array of drugs and treatment - they are given the option of exercise clubs, arts groups, metal work clubs and yoga.</p><p>The concept - known as social prescribing - is based on evidence that shows about a fifth of patients visiting GPs have a social rather than medical problem.</p><p>The scheme - run by Voluntary Action, a partnership of more than 20 organisations - was launched in 2012. </p><p>Now, every GP practice is using it and more than 2,000 patients have benefited.</p><p>GPs and social workers refer those who they believe would benefit to one of five social-prescribing workers. </p><p>They visit the patient in their home to carry out an assessment and work out what prescription to offer them.</p><p>It certainly seems to be working. An evaluation has found A&amp;E visits have dropped by a fifth among those who have had a social prescription.</p><p>The council and local NHS has started working together in the London borough of Sutton to keep care home residents well.</p><p>GPs have been employed to carry out regular visits of care homes, with each resident now receiving six-monthly check-ups.</p><p>A pharmacist is on hand to visit homes to carry out medicine reviews.</p><p>And district nurses have been used to train care home staff in dementia, falls and diabetes.</p><p>It certainly seems to be working.</p><p>Since the project started in 2015, there has been a 10% drop in visits to A&amp;E.</p><p>But help is also on hand when care home residents need to go into hospital.</p><p>It's a relatively simple concept. </p><p>When a care home resident needs to go into a hospital, a red bag is packed for them.</p><p>It contains their details, vital information about their health conditions, supplies of medicine, and even a change of clothes for when they are ready to be discharged - after cases where hospitals had to borrow clothes from lost property when patients had been ready for discharge.</p><p>The initiative also sees a member of the care home staff visiting the patient in hospital within 48 hours of admission.</p><p>And this all helps doctors and nurses treat them more effectively.</p><p>The result is older people are spending less time in hospital - eight days, which is four fewer than before the scheme was set up.</p>
