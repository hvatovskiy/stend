<p>Campaigners say ministers have not worked with local councils to find enough places for vulnerable children.</p><p>Separately, the daughter of the man called "Britain's Schindler" has criticised the ending of the "Dubs amendment" child refugee scheme.</p><p>Ministers argue the arrangement is "a pull" for children and traffickers.</p><p>On Wednesday, the government ended the Dubs amendment scheme, designed by the Labour peer and former child refugee, Lord Dubs.</p><p><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/19/section/67/enacted" class="story-body__link-external">The amendment</a>, which was attached to the Immigration Act last year, required the Home Office to allow some of the most vulnerable unaccompanied children stranded in Europe into the UK.</p><p>However, refugee groups and charities have previously accused the government of dragging its feet on the issue. </p><p>The High Court case - which began before the government's announcement on Wednesday - argues that ministers have failed to work hard enough to find sufficient places for the children.</p><p>The court is expected to reserve its judgement until a later date.</p><p>Barbara Winton, daughter of Sir Nicholas Winton - who helped save hundreds of children from the Nazis in World War Two - called on the prime minister to reinstate the Dubs amendment.</p><p>In a letter to Theresa May, she said her father said the UK had "a responsibility to offer sanctuary those fleeing persecution".</p><p>"'If it's not impossible', he used to say, 'then surely something could and something must be done'," she wrote.</p><p>She called on prime minister to "remember" the words she used at a memorial to Sir Nicholas, when Mrs May said she hoped his life would "encourage us to do the right thing".</p><p>"As the world once again teeters on the edge of dark times, I ask you to remember those words," she added.</p><p>Ministers said 350 children would have arrived under the scheme by the time it ends in March, but there were fears it encouraged people traffickers.</p><p>Lord Dubs and his supporters have suggested the UK could help 3,000 of the most vulnerable.</p><p>On Thursday, church leaders, charities, MPs and peers also condemned the decision to close the scheme.</p><p>The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said he was "saddened and shocked" at the government's decision to limit the number to 350, saying he hoped ministers would reconsider the decision.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lord Dubs said: "I believe in arbitrarily closing down the scheme, without any good reason for doing so, the government is in breach of its own commitments."</p><p>Home Secretary Amber Rudd defended the approach to the Dubs scheme - saying UK and French authorities feared it had provided opportunities for people-traffickers.</p><p>Speaking in the Commons, she said: "I am clear that when working with my French counterparts they do not want us to indefinitely continue to accept children under the Dubs amendment because they specify, and I agree with them, that it acts as a draw.</p><p>"It acts as a pull. It encourages the people traffickers."</p>
