<p>Health workers and activists crowded onto the deck of the Nautical Aliya as it docked at Thilawa port near Myanmar's commercial capital on Thursday carrying food, medical aid, and clothing.</p>
<p>Organisers of the aid shipment said they trust the Myanmar government to deliver the supplies as promised despite its record of discrimination.</p>
<p>"We have to respect Myanmar's sovereignty," said Razali Ramli, from the 1Putera Club Malaysia, which helped organise the shipment along with a coalition of non-government organisations. "We hand over the aid in good faith."</p>
<p>Myanmar's social welfare minister was among a delegation meeting the ship, which has been at the centre of a rare diplomatic spat with fellow ASEAN member Malaysia.</p>
<p>Outside the docking area, dozens of Buddhist monks and demonstrators waited waving national flags and signs reading: "No Rohingya".</p>

<p>"We want to let them know that we have no Rohingya here," a Buddhist monk named Thuseitta, from the Yangon chapter of the Patriotic Myanmar Monks Union, told AFP news agency.</p>
<p>Myanmar denies citizenship to the million-strong Rohingya, despite many of them living on its soil for generations.</p>
<p>Buddhist nationalist groups are especially strong in their vitriol, rejecting Rohingya as illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Rohingya have reportedly been killed in a brutal campaign launched by security forces in October, which the United Nations says may amount to ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>The violence started after <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/myanmar-fears-violence-deadly-border-attack-161011133128765.html">a series of attacks</a> by armed men on border posts killed nine policemen. </p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Rohingya have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh, bringing harrowing tales of murder and sexual assault.</p>
<p>"We've document atrocities, serious crimes that have been committed by Myanmar's security forces," Matthew Smith, executive director of the group Fortify Rights, told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>"We're documenting killings, we're documenting mass rape … throats being slit, bodies being thrown into fires, villages burned to the ground." </p>
<p>Myanmar's treatment of the Rohingya has sparked criticism from Muslim-majority Malaysia in a rare spat between the Southeast Asian neighbours.</p>
<p>Myanmar initially refused to allow the aid ship into its waters and has barred it from sailing to Rakhine's state capital, Sittwe.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera's Yaara Bou Melhem, reporting from Yangon, said the aid will be unloaded and distributed by the government from there.</p>
<p>"What we know is that a plane from here in Yangon will take the aid to Sittwe, which is nearest to the conflict zone ... to distribute the aid among both Rohingya and Buddists," she said.</p>
<p>"There's no clear indication the aid will reach the Rohingya, because the area has been in lockdown since the renewed fighting began in October."</p>
<p>The delivery comes days after <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56103#.WJxMqlV97cs">a blistering report</a> from the UN accused Myanmar's security forces of carrying out a campaign of rape, torture, and mass killings against the Rohingya.</p>
<p>Based on interviews with hundreds of escapees in Bangladesh, investigators said the military's "calculated policy of terror" likely amounted to ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>For months, Myanmar has dismissed similar testimonies gathered by foreign media and rights groups as "fake news" and curtailed access to the region.</p>
