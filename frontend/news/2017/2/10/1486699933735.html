More than three million people - including 460,000 children - are acutely malnourished and the situation is deteriorating on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The UN says 7.3 million Yemenis do not know where their next meal is coming from. The crisis has been brought on by nearly two years of civil war. Iran-backed Houthis have been fighting a Saudi-led coalition.</p>
<p>At least 10,000 people have been killed. The death toll from hunger and disease is much greater. A child under the age of five is dying every five minutes.</p>
<p>The international community is being urged to find $2.1bn to help ease the situation. The majority of the population has only limited access to food and medicine. The UN has described the crisis as "catastrophic" and rapidly deteriorating.</p>
<p>What does it take to help millions of helpless people in a country ravaged by war?</p>
