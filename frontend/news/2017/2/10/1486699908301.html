<p>According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the insect group is the most threatened of those assessed so far in Europe. </p><p>Europe harbours more than 1,000 species of grasshopper and cricket. </p><p>If we don't act now the sound of crickets could become a thing of the past, said the IUCN.</p><p>Crickets, bush crickets and grasshoppers - a group known as<i> Orthoptera</i> - live on grassland.</p><p>They are an important food source for birds and reptiles, and their decline could affect entire ecosystems. </p><p>Their habitat is being lost due to wildfires, intensive agriculture and tourism development.</p><p>Jean-Christophe Vi√©, deputy director, IUCN Global Species Programme, said to bring these species back from the brink of extinction, more needs to be done to protect and restore their habitats.</p><p>"This can be done through sustainable grassland management using traditional agricultural practices, for example," he said. </p><p>"If we do not act now, the sound of crickets in European grasslands could soon become a thing of the past."</p><p>The assessment took place over two years and involved more than 150 scientists.</p><p>Axel Hochkirch is chair of the IUCN invertebrate conservation sub-committee and lead author of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/redlist/orthoptera/summary.htm?dm_i=2QBL,E62V,2KAHDP,1FRJW,1" class="story-body__link-external">report</a>.</p><p>"If we lose grasshoppers and other <i>Orthoptera</i> like crickets and bush crickets, we will lose diversity," he told BBC News. "They are very good indicators of biodiversity in open ecosystems."</p><p>The experts are particularly concerned about species that occupy small ranges, such as the Crau plain grasshopper, which lives only on the Crau plain in the South of France.</p><p>Some populations are also being lost through wildfires, particularly in Greece and on the Canary Islands.</p><p>"The results from this IUCN Red List are deeply worrying," said Luc Bas, director of the IUCN European Regional Office. </p><p>The report recommends the setting up of a monitoring programme across Europe to obtain information on population trends.</p>
