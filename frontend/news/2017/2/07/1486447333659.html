    <div class=""><p>The number of civilian casualties as a result of the conflict in Afghanistan reached its highest point in 2016 <span>since the UN began keeping records.</span></p>
<p>Over 11,500 people <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/afghan-civilian-casualties-2016-170206062807210.html" target="_blank">were killed or wounded</a> last year as a result of the fight between the Afghan government and anti-government groups.</p>
<p>According to research from the United Nations, about one third of the victims were children. Most of the casualties (61 percent) were <span>caused by armed groups like the Taliban and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).</span> Afghan security forces and a<span>ir raids by international warplanes were responsible for the other 39 percent.</span></p>
<p>Fighting in several areas of Afghanistan continues, as <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2016/08/afghanistan-controls-160823083528213.html" target="_blank">this map shows</a>. The Taliban has gained ground in several key places in the country.</p></div>
