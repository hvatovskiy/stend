<p>The security guard, also an Afghan national, opened fire on <span>Mohammad Zaki Uro, a third political secretary based at the consulate in the southern city of Karachi, Hamid Hamdard, an Afghan diplomat at the embassy in Islamabad, told Al Jazeera.</span></p>
<p>"The guard, Rehmat Ullah, opened fire on a junior diplomat Mohammad Zaki Uro, killing him on the spot and wounding another consulate official," senior police official Azad Khan told the AFP news agency.</p>
<p>Security forces and a heavy police contingent surrounded the consulate immediately after the attack amid fears of a possible assault.</p>
<p>"There was nothing of the sort and it seems the guard had some sort of personal grudge with the diplomat," Khan said.</p>
<p>A local police official told the Reuters news agency that the guard "used his automatic weapon, firing multiple bullets".</p>
<p><span>Omar Zakhilwal, the </span>Afghan ambassador to Pakistan, confirmed the shooting on his official Facebook account.</p>
<p>"Firing inside Afg Consulate General in Karachi at around 12:30 pm today ... has been carried out by an Afghan guard inside the compound resulting in fatality of one of our diplomats," Zakhilwal wrote.</p>
<p>The consulate is located in Karachi's upscale Clifton neighbourhood. The missions of Indonesia, Britain and France are nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
