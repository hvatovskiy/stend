<p>We asked some of those who have fallen ill, and the families of others, to share their experiences of winter 2016-17.</p><p><strong>Sue's </strong>father's life changed dramatically after he fell out of bed while in hospital in December 2016. </p><p>Geoff, 84, had been admitted to hospital near their house in Cornwall for a hip operation.</p><p>Sue says she was not told about his fall for several days, eventually she was told he would not walk again and possibly had only six months left to live. </p><p>"I am devastated - six weeks ago everything was fine, now this is not the world I imagined I'd be in.</p><p>"In December he was walking into town, doing gardening, he loved mechanics and tinkering.</p><p>"Now in hospital his mental health has really deteriorated, he does not speak and strips naked in public. </p><p>"I blame the trauma of the fall and the time he's been forced to spend in hospital.</p><p>"I'm really on edge, I feel like I'm about to fall off a cliff.</p><p>"I break down in tears at least once a day. </p><p>"He's had his life taken away too soon.</p><p>"Are we saying that because he's too complicated, our society can't care for him? </p><p>"It seems like such a big fight to just find out from the hospital what is going on. </p><p>"I just hope to God that he doesn't understand what is happening to him.</p><p>"I feel like he'll never come home again, he seems lost to us."</p><p><strong>John Perrins </strong>was on the M6 motorway, driving home from Cambridge, when he realised he was having a heart attack. </p><p>An ambulance driver himself, he had feared he would never see his wife again - so intense was the pain. But a paramedic saved his life at the side of the road.</p><p>"I was vomiting and felt like a horse was kicking me in the chest. </p><p>"My wife called an ambulance, which arrived within 10 minutes - seeing the blue lights was the most wonderful thing I've ever seen. </p><p>"I passed out, but apparently they performed three lots of heart massage - 90 compressions. </p><p>"When I came round they spoke to me and, although I was scared, the way that the paramedic spoke to me made me feel safe.</p><p>"The ambulance crew were absolutely phenomenal. </p><p>"A friend who is a paramedic came to see me and he told me that the last six heart attack patients he worked on had died - I felt so lucky that I had this particular ambulance crew. </p><p>"They have given me my life back.</p><p>"The paramedic was treating me, teaching a trainee and looking after my wife in the ambulance - I could not have asked for a better person. </p><p>"I am trying to find out the names of the ambulance crew - I want to find them so I can say thank you."</p><p><strong>Trevor Dallimore-Wright </strong>says his local GP and hospital are "like a family" to him, regularly providing life-saving care for his complex health conditions.</p><p>"The NHS has been absolutely brilliant," says Trevor, from London, who has diabetes and depression.</p><p>"My GP keeps me sane and out of hospital - I would give her 10 out of 10. </p><p>"I've had emergency admittance twice recently with sepsis - I went to A&amp;E and was treated very quickly. </p><p>"They've had a great impact on my life. </p><p>"NHS treatment has helped me during the times that I could not get out of bed. </p><p>"My GP is extremely kind and patient. They are so patient-centred, I would put them in the luxury bracket. </p><p>"All the hospital staff are extraordinarily friendly. </p><p>"They are there despite the infrastructure problems in the NHS, and the care could not be better. </p><p>"From the moment I walk in, I know I'm being looked after. </p><p>"My only problem is that the NHS won't pay for immunotherapy drugs which are at the front line of treatment but are expensive."</p><p>Thirty six-year-old <strong>Nikki Alldis' </strong>satisfaction levels are at the other end of the spectrum, however, despite also living London. She says she has waited 15 months for a bowel operation, which has been twice cancelled.</p><p>When the procedure was scheduled for early January, she mentally prepared her young children and rearranged her work. But Nikki has twice received a last-minute call telling her there is no bed space.</p><p>She is still waiting.</p><p>"I'd prepared mentally - I planned my whole Christmas around the operation and recovery. I prepared frozen dinners for my kids, they are seven and 13, and I said a farewell goodbye. </p><p>"Then in the morning the nurse called me and said, 'We have no bed for you.'</p><p>"I was gutted. The kids were so confused when they came home and I was still there.</p><p>"I've been waiting for 15 months now - it's hanging over me.</p><p>"I did not believe the second appointment would happen, but I packed my bags anyway. </p><p>"We didn't even bother to rearrange my husband's work that time, if he's not working we're not earning, so we can't afford these cancellations.</p><p>"I put things in place with my work for people to cover me.</p><p>"I'm still waiting, hopefully it's third time lucky."</p><p>When 29-year-old <strong>Paul</strong> was feeling suicidal in January, the NHS crisis care team in west London gave him 24-hour care to keep him safe.</p><p>He has received treatment for bipolar disorder for four years and says his consultant and crisis team are outstanding.</p><p>"They helped me in my darkest and most depressive hours," says Paul, who asked for his surname not to be revealed.</p><p>"I came back home after New Year and went back to day-to-day life, but it kicked off a hefty depression and I was left feeling really low and suicidal. </p><p>"My partner called the crisis team, and they came to our house three or four times a day. </p><p>"They come at 02:00 or 03:00, they are really responsive.</p><p>"I don't feel like they are just doing their jobs, they have genuine care for me.</p><p>"They take away my medication to make sure I will not overdose and when they visit, they make me take the medication. </p><p>"Sometimes they just spend time with me. </p><p>"They ask how I am, what did you eat and sometimes they make me do things like go and buy some milk, which I don't always feel able to do. </p><p>"I would not be alive without them.</p><p>"But one problem I have with NHS mental health care is that they medicate but do not do counselling, there is a massive waiting list, so now I have to get counselling privately."</p><p>"Before she was diagnosed with cancer, my mum could run a marathon," says <strong>Richard Taylor</strong>, 55 from Liverpool. </p><p>He was devastated after watching her "undignified" death last month. </p><p>The local cancer centre did not have the capacity to give her end-of-life care. </p><p>"After she received the second diagnosis, she was sent home and we got caught in a communication loop between three hospitals. It was an emotional rollercoaster. </p><p>"Eventually I had to take her to A&amp;E  - she could not eat or drink.  </p><p>"She spent 13 hours on a trolley, behind a curtain in a noisy and busy ward. </p><p>"I stayed on a chair beside her and slept on the floor - she died a week later.</p><p>"My gripe is with the lack of communication and the delays in my mum's treatment. </p><p>"The nursing staff were fantastic, but there is only so much they can do - they could not give my mum 24-hour attention.</p><p>"She was a very proud and dignified woman - but in the end she was simply scared to be alone. </p><p>"It was awful watching someone die in this extremely undignified way. </p><p>"If she was an animal, they would have put her down - she was starving and dehydrated.</p><p>"The nurses were lovely and compassionate, but they offered me no support.</p><p>"The NHS is a great thing, but it is under the hammer."</p><p>A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year.</p>
