<p>Led by 20-year-old  Sima Azimi,  the Shaolin Wushu club practises on a snow-covered mountaintop to the west of Kabul. </p><p>Developed from ancient Chinese martial arts, the sport of wushu sees these young women moving fluidly, slicing the air with silver swords. </p><p>After learning the sport in Iran, Sima won medals in competition and says: "My ambition is to see my students take part in international matches and win medals for their country."</p><p>Despite the popularity of martial arts in Afghanistan, women's sport is severely restricted. </p><p>All of the women in the club are Hazara, a Dari-speaking, mainly Shia group. They have generally more liberal social traditions that allow them to practise sports outside the home.</p><p>In addition to the regular dangers of life in Kabul, these women face intimidation and abuse.  One member, Shakila Muradi, says: "There are many people harassing us, but we ignore them and follow our goals." </p><p>Sima has been teaching in Kabul for about a year, training at the club's gym with her father. </p><p>This gym has a large poster of stuntman Hussain Sadiqi, a Hazara martial arts champion who fled to Australia to work in film. </p>
