<p><a href="https://www.parsemusfoundation.org/projects/vasalgel/" class="story-body__link-external">Vasalgel</a> acts as a physical barrier once injected into the tubes that sperm would swim down to the penis. </p><p>The company behind it says a two-year trial, published in <a href="https://bacandrology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12610-017-0048-9" class="story-body__link-external">Basic and Clinical Andrology</a>, shows the gel works and is safe - at least in primates. </p><p>It hopes to have enough evidence to begin tests in men next few years.</p><p>If those get funding and go well - two big "ifs" - it will seek regulatory approval to make the gel more widely available to men. </p><p>It would be the first new type of male contraceptive to hit the market in many decades.</p><p>At the moment, men have two main options of contraceptive - wear a condom to catch the sperm, or have a sterilising operation (vasectomy) to cut or seal the two tubes that carry sperm to the penis from where they are made in the testicles.</p><p>Vasalgel has the same end effect as vasectomy, but researchers hope it should be easier to reverse if a man later decides he wants to have children.</p><p>In theory, another injection should dissolve the gel plug. </p><p>That worked in early tests in rabbits, but the researchers have yet to prove the same in monkeys and man.</p><p>The idea behind Vasalgel is not new.  </p><p>Another experimental male birth control gel - RISUG (reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance) - that works in a similar way to Vasalgel is being tested in men in India. </p><p>Unlike RISUG, Vasalgel is not designed to impair the swimming sperm.</p><p>It merely blocks their path while still letting other fluid through, according to the manufacturer.</p><p>Both gels are given as an injection, under anaesthetic, and are meant to offer long-acting contraception.</p><p>The University of California researchers tested the gel on 16 adult male monkeys, 10 of whom were already fathers. </p><p>The monkeys were monitored for a week after getting the injection and were then released back into their an enclosure to rejoin some fertile females. </p><p>Mating did occur, but none of the female monkeys became pregnant over the course of the study, which included two full breeding periods for some of the animals.  </p><p>Few of the male monkeys had side-effects, although one did need an operation because the injection did not go to plan and damaged one of his tubes. </p><p>Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, said: "The study shows that, in adult male monkeys at least, the gel is an effective form of contraception. </p><p>"But in order for it to have a chance of replacing the traditional surgical method of vasectomy, the authors need to show that the procedure is reversible."</p><p>He said there had been very little commercial interest from pharmaceutical companies in this kind of a approach. </p><p>The non-profit company researching Vasalgel, the Parsemus Foundation, has used grants and fundraising to get this far. </p><p>Prof Pacey said: "The idea of a social venture company to develop the idea is intriguing. </p><p>"I would imagine there is a worldwide market for a new male contraceptive, but trials in humans and more long-term safety data are required before we will know if it is a success."</p><p>This type of contraceptive wouldn't protect against sexually transmitted infections such as HIV.</p><p>But in terms of willingness, experts believe men would be up for trying new contraceptives, such as a gel. </p><p>Dr Anatole Menon-Johanssonm from the sexual health charity Brook, said: "Some men do want to be part of the solution and do their part. </p><p>"If you can have more options available then maybe more men would go for it."</p><p>He said the idea of a "reversible vasectomy" was desirable, whereas asking some men to take hormones to control their fertility might be "a big ask".</p>
