<p>The eponymously titled White Helmets, a 40-minute Netflix film, gives a window into lives of the group's volunteers as they scramble to pull people from the rubble of bombed out building flatted in bombing raids.</p>
<p>Accepting the Academy Award, director Orlando von Einsiedel urged the audience to stand up and call for an end to Syria's six-year civil war, which led to a standing ovation.</p>
<p>Von Einsiedel read out a statement from White Helmets founder Raed al-Saleh, in which he thanked the academy and said the group had saved tens of thousands of lives since it was formed in 2014.</p>
<p>"We are so grateful that this film has highlighted our work to the world. Our organisation is guided by a verse from the Quran: to save one life is to save all of humanity," Saleh's statement said.</p>
<p>"We have saved more than 82,000 Syrian lives. I invite anyone here who hears me to work on the side of life to stop the bloodshed in Syria and around the world."</p>

<p>Rescue workers in Syria are at risk of being killed in so-called "double tap" air raids that target them as they arrive at the scene of an air strike. The group says that many of its volunteers have been killed.</p>
<p>Syrian cinematographer Khaled Khatib who worked on the documentary was unable to attend after being <a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/syrian-white-helmets-cinematographer-barred-170225050444985.html" target="_blank"> barred from entering the United States </a> , despite being granted a visa .</p>
<p>US officials reportedly discovered "derogatory information" about him, according to a document seen by the Associated Press news agency .</p>
<p>The film's producer Joanna Natasegara told AP on Sunday that the decision was "sad and confusing."</p>
<p>The incident happened after President Donald Trump's <a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/trump-vows-introduce-overhauled-travel-ban-170217035418856.html" target="_blank"> now halted temporary travel ban </a> , which targeted seven Muslim-majority countries, including Syria.</p>
