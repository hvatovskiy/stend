<p>The touching and beautifully-shot drama about growing up gay and black in Miami is seen as an outside bet to upset the La La Land bandwagon at the Oscars.</p><p>It confirmed its status as the awards circuit's second favourite film with six Independent Spirit Awards.</p><p>La La Land wasn't eligible for the awards, which reward low-budget films.</p><p>Moonlight was made for $1.5m (£1.2m) over 25 days - but has now recouped $21.5m (£17.3m) at the North American box office. It also has eight Oscar nominations, compared with La La Land's 14.</p><p>In his acceptance speech, Casey Affleck, who won best male lead, gave a taste of the political tone that is likely to dominate the Oscars.</p><p>He told the ceremony: "The policies of this administration are abhorrent and they will not last. They're really un-American. </p><p>"I know this feels preachy and boring and I'm preaching to the choir but I'm just lending my little voice to the chorus here."</p><p>British actress Naomie Harris, who appears in Moonlight, said the current political climate is "definitely going to be reflected" at the Oscars.</p><p>"Really great art reflects society," she told BBC News. "It also edifies us. It shows us a different way of operating. So I definitely think it's going to be a very political year this year at the Oscars."</p><p>She also said Moonlight has struck a chord because it has fed "our universal yearning for connection".</p><p>She said: "We're all yearning to connect, and I think in a society where we have so much technology that makes us feel as though we're connected, but it's not really about true connection. It's not heartfelt connection.</p><p>"And that's what we're all longing for, and I think that, in Moonlight, is what's demonstrated."</p><p>The Independent Spirits ceremony is the traditional precursor to the Oscars and is one of the awards season's more informal events. It honours films made for less than $20m (£16m).</p>
