<p>Thousands of government supporters, some wearing clothing adorned with Mugabe's image in younger days, converged in Matabeleland for Saturday's birthday bash and show of strength for the ruling ZANU-PF party.</p>
<p>Also wearing a multi-coloured suit emblazoned with his own image and dark glasses, Mugabe,  the world's oldest head of state, told the crowd he had no intention of stepping down.</p>
<p>"People who are busy forming their own groupings saying 'Mr Mugabe must go'. I ask myself where should I go?" Mugabe, who has been in power for 37 years,  said in a speech that was broadcast on state radio and television.</p>
<p>Speaking for over an hour, Mugabe said he would not impose his successor and that if ZANU-PF party felt he should retire, it would hold an extraordinary congress to choose a new leader.</p>
<p>"Others are saying 'President, choose a successor before you retire'. Is that not imposition? Me imposing someone on the party? No, I don't want that," Mugabe said.</p>
<p>"This is an issue for the congress to choose. We can have an extraordinary congress if the president retires, but you said I should be your candidate in the next election."</p>
<p>His hands gripping the podium, Mugabe spoke slowly. He said that at times he felt alone, but that he has a "mission" and "mandate" as <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/zimbabwe.html"> Zimbabwe </a> 's leader and appealed for the ruling party to overcome its divisions.</p>
<p>"It's not always easy to predict that, although you are alive this year, you will be alive next year," he said.</p>
<p>"It does not matter how healthy you might feel. The decision that you continue to live and enjoy life is that of one personality we call the Almighty God."</p>

<p>Guests at the birthday party enjoyed pieces of a cake weighing 93kg, according to party organiser Kudzai Chipanga.</p>
<p>The cake was shaped like the continent of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/africa.html"> Africa </a> because "everyone in Africa loves him", said Chipanga.</p>
<p>ZANU-PF officials said hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on the birthday bash at a school in Matobo, just outside Zimbabwe's second-largest city, Bulawayo.</p>
<p>But critics said the money should have been used for other priorities amid a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/zimbabweans-sleep-banks-cash-crisis-worsens-161111191648232.html"> deepening economic crisis </a> .</p>
<p>Zimbabwe's economy is set to contract by 2.5 percent this year, according to the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/imf.html"> International Monetary Fund </a> .</p>
<p>More than 80 percent of the workforce scrape a living in the informal sector, while the government has failed to pay civil servants' salaries on time since June. </p>
<p>Mugabe celebrated his actual birthday on February 21 with a smaller cake-cutting ceremony.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
