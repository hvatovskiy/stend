<p>In a statement on Sunday, the interior minister citing police figures said that <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/germany.html">Germany</a> recorded more than 3,500 attacks in total against refugees, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/migrants.html">migrants</a> and their shelters last year, amounting to nearly 10 acts of anti-migrant violence a day.</p>
<p>The attacks left at least 560 people injured, including 43 children.</p>
<p>"People who have fled their home country and seek protection in Germany have the right to expect safe shelter," the interior ministry said, according to the AFP news agency.</p>

<p>In one case, a German neo-Nazi was sentenced to eight years in jail in February for burning down a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/sport.html">sports</a> hall set to house refugees, causing damage worth $3.7m.</p>
<p>In another example that shocked the country one year ago, a crowd of onlookers cheered and applauded as an asylum shelter went up in flames in the country's former communist east.</p>
<p><span>Ulla Jelpke, an MP for the socialist Die Linke party, blamed anti-migrant violence on proponents of the country's far-right and urged the government to take stronger action.</span></p>
<p>"We're seeing nearly 10 [criminal] acts a day," she told the Funke Mediengruppe, a German regional newspaper group. "Do people have to die before the right-wing violence is considered a central domestic security problem and makes it to the top of the national policy agenda?"</p>

<p>There were 988 attacks including arson on shelters for refugees and <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/asylum-seekers.html">asylum seekers</a>, a similar number to last year. In 2014, there were only 199 such cases.</p>
<p>The sharp rise in hate crimes came after Germany, which hosts the largest refugee population in <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/europe.html">Europe</a>, took 890,000 asylum seekers in 2015 at the height of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2016/03/refugee-crisis-eyes-refugees-160321064233481.html">Europe's refugee crisis</a>.</p>
<p>Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to welcome refugees polarised the country and fuelled support for far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.</p>
<p>The number of arrivals fell sharply in 2016 to 280,000, mainly due to border closures on the Balkan overland route and an <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/03/refugee-crisis-eu-turkey-agree-proposal-160308021149403.html">EU deal with Turkey</a> to stem the flow.</p>
