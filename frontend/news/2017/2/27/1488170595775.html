<p>Italy led 10-5 at half-time as they chose not to compete at the breakdown, allowing them to step into the England line without going offside.</p><p>But the hosts found a way through with five tries in the second period.</p><p>"Well done Italy, very smart. We knew they'd come with something," Jones told BBC Radio 5 live.</p><p>"But it wasn't rugby. We haven't played a game of rugby yet.</p><p>"I'm not critical of Italy, they did what they needed to do to stay in the game."</p><p>Italy coach Conor O'Shea defended the tactic, saying: "Everything we did was completely legal; I was incredibly proud of what the players put out there."</p><p>At one stage, England captain Dylan Hartley and team-mate James Haskell asked referee Romain Poite to clarify the law, but the Frenchman replied: "I am a referee, not a coach."</p><p>Jones added: "Did we react quick enough? It's hard when you don't play rugby, it's like playing a different game out there.</p><p>"If your half-back can't pass the ball, the game becomes difficult. It's not the way you want to play the game. We wanted to move the ball and play some good rugby.</p><p>"We scored six tries and at the end of three rounds, if we were undefeated and with a bonus points, we'd be doing handstands. So we're doing handstands."</p><p>Italy played a novel tactic of not committing any men to the breakdown beyond the initial tackler, meaning no ruck was formed and any offside became irrelevant.</p><p>Italian defenders could therefore stand between England's half-backs, creating confusion for the men in white.</p><p>"How can you have players standing in your attack line? Even when there were rucks, there were people standing in our attack line. </p><p>"You look to pass the ball and there's a blue jumper there. You look in front and there's a blue jumper there. There's blue jumpers everywhere.</p><p>"He [Poite] had a terrible day. He wasn't refereeing rugby."</p><p>Asked if rugby's laws need to change following the game, Jones said: "I don't think anyone wants to see a game like that. No-one likes to see rugby not played in its proper form so World Rugby will have to have a very close look at it. </p><p>"I don't think there was anything good in that today. It didn't improve the game."</p><p>The innovative tactics caused confusion among the spectators as well as those on the field, and former England scrum-half Matt Dawson laid the blame for a disjointed contest firmly with Italy. </p><p>The 2003 World Cup winner <a class="sp-story-body__external-link" href="https://twitter.com/matt9dawson/status/835887286948626438">said on Twitter:<i class="sp-story-body__external-link-icon gelicon gelicon--external" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> "Well done Italy on ruining this international. Now World Rugby have to change the laws because of your inability to compete at this level."</p><p>O'Shea was not about to back down when Dawson's comment was put to him, saying: "I'd like him to sit down with World Rugby to look at some of the other games we've played this year, and if he's that good in the rules, actually make a comment after we were impacted as we were in the first game of this championship - but that's not for me to talk about now.</p><p>"We came here to have a go. If they want us to lose by 100 points, why should we? Why should we be normal? We should be ourselves. Rather than having a go, have a bit of humility and respect for guys who have very little in comparison to their counterparts.</p><p>"I was expecting this, if I'm honest."</p><p>Jones went on to compare the Italian tactic to a famous one-day international cricket match between Australia and New Zealand in 1981.</p><p>With one ball remaining, New Zealand needed a six to tie the match.</p><p>To ensure this couldn't happen, Australia's captain Greg Chappell ordered his brother Trevor to bowl the last ball underarm, a legal action at the time.</p><p>"Well, obviously they've been watching Trevor Chappell with the underarm bowl along the ground to make sure they couldn't hit a six," said Australian Jones.</p><p>"I'm sure Trevor Chappell would've been happy today."</p><p>England have a two-week rest before they take on Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday, 11 March, and another victory would see them equal New Zealand's world record of 18 Test matches unbeaten.</p><p>"We've got Scotland in two weeks and they've got belief and confidence," said Jones. "We are looking forward to them coming down and I'm sure they're going to play proper rugby.</p><p>"This is our next test, and I'm sure [Scotland coach] Vern Cotter won't have those tactics. He's a New Zealander. They like the breakdown and the contest. </p>
