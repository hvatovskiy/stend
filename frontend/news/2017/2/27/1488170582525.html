<p>Women from all over Punjab have travelled to the capital to seek help from Amanjot Kaur Ramoowalia - the head of a <a href="http://helpinghapless.org/" class="story-body__link-external">charity for women</a> abandoned by their foreign-national husbands. </p><p>Ms Ramoowalia estimates there are more than 15,000 women across the state, who are in this situation. </p><p>She sees around 15 abandoned wives a month and says the numbers are increasing. </p><p>"I see a lot of beautiful, educated women. They are in a mess," she told <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0071mkv" class="story-body__link">BBC Inside Out</a>.</p><p>"They are ashamed to live in a society as an abandoned wife. I believe this is a big violation of human rights."</p><p>Their husbands come from all over the world, but mainly countries with a large South Asian diaspora, like the UK, the US and Canada. </p><p>The women agree to the marriages in the hope of embarking on a better life abroad. </p><p>But for many of their grooms, the motivation is money rather than love. </p><p>A third of the men are believed to be from Britain. </p><p> Ms Ramoowalia said: "He (the groom) comes here and he asks for a massive dowry. </p><p>"They marry. He takes the money and enjoys the honeymoon. Then he never comes back."</p><p>In India, it is customary for the bride's family to give money or gifts to the groom, despite the practice being outlawed in 1961. The dowries often amount to tens of thousands of pounds.  </p><p>One of the women at the secret meeting has travelled from a rural village on the outskirts of Punjab.</p><p>Kamaljit Kaur married a man from Italy three years ago. But just months after their wedding, he left her.</p><p>She was pregnant with his child at the time. </p><p>"Soon after we got married…he started complaining about the dowry. He said my family isn't happy with you."</p><p>You can watch <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0071mkv" class="story-body__link">Outcast Wives: An Inside Out Special</a> on BBC One London, Monday at 19:30 GMT.</p><p>It will also be broadcast on BBC World on 4 March will be available on the iPlayer for 30 days. </p><p>Kamaljit's husband eventually left the family home and returned to Italy. She hasn't seen him since. </p><p>Their baby daughter was born with serious health problems - but her in-laws refused to help. </p><p>"They said the baby is born disabled. We don't want anything to do with her. Our relations are over."</p><p>Sadly, Kamaljit's baby died months later. Her husband did not contact her.</p><p>Divorcing a foreign national in India is an extremely complex and expensive process. </p><p>Often the women's families are also adversely affected. </p><p>Darshan's daughter got married back in 1997, but they're still waiting for closure. </p><p>"He didn't say anything until he was leaving. He said I'm married abroad. I have a son and a daughter so I can't take your daughter. Do whatever you want. </p><p>"We took legal action. I've been trapped in this mess for 16 years."</p><p>Daljit Kaur is a lawyer for the <a href="http://nripunjab.gov.in/index.htm" class="story-body__link-external">Non-Resident Indian Commission of Punjab</a>, which deals with legal cases against foreign nationals. </p><p>She said: "Our legal system is a bit slow and it will take years to get a decision. </p><p>"There are a number of difficulties… and moreover these girls don't have the money to pay for the legal system."</p><p>Back under the baking sun of Chandigarh, Amonjot Kaur Ramoowalia is giving advice to dozens of women in this exact situation. </p><p>But the assistance she can offer is limited. Whilst abandonment is considered a crime in India, once a foreign national leaves the jurisdiction it's extremely difficult to prosecute him.</p><p>She says some of the stories she hears are utterly appalling.</p><p>"One girl got married. He raped her in a systematic way and left her with a child.  There's no strong law you can follow. </p><p>"She had to live the rest of her life, with the shame of being an abandoned wife."</p><p>Ms Ramoowalia says other countries should be aware of the actions of their citizens and co-operate with the Indian government in holding them accountable.</p>
