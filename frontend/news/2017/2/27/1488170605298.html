<p>How many of this year's attendees, though, will try to top the outfits of the past that made a lasting impression - and not always for the best reasons?</p><p>One of the most outrageous gowns in Oscar history must surely be the infamous dress that Icelandic pop star <strong>Bjork </strong>swanned in on in 2001.</p><p>Marjan Pejoski's creation was roundly mocked at the time but later took pride of place at a Bjork retrospective at New York's Museum of Modern Art.</p><p>Two years before winning her Oscar for Moonstruck, <strong>Cher </strong>turned up to present one in a startling Bob Mackie creation topped with a massive feathered headdress.</p><p>"As you can see, I did receive my Academy booklet on how to dress like a serious actress," she joked before giving Cocoon's Don Ameche his supporting actor Oscar in 1986.</p><p>Australian costume designer <strong>Lizzy Gardiner</strong> deserved a lot of credit in 1995 for attending the Oscars in a dress made up of 254 expired American Express Gold cards.</p><p>Gardiner, who shared her award for The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert with fellow Aussie Tim Chappel, later auctioned off the gown for charity.</p><p><strong>Angelina Jolie</strong> went out on a limb by revealing a bare leg as she arrived at the 2012 Academy Awards in this black Atelier Versace ballgown.</p><p>Her exposed flesh swiftly went viral, with online pranksters adding it to images of everything from the Statue of Liberty to Whistler's Mother.</p><p><strong>Celine Dion</strong> certainly reversed the trend at the 1999 ceremony by wearing a white Christian Dior tuxedo - backwards.</p><p>In an interview, the singer said she was only wearing her diamond-encrusted sunglasses because their makers had pledged $50,000 to one of her favoured charities.</p><p>Not to be outdone, South Park creators <strong>Trey Parker</strong> and <strong>Matt Stone</strong> dragged themselves down the red carpet at the 2000 Oscars as Jennifer Lopez and Gwyneth Paltrow respectively.</p><p>Parker's green gown mirrored the one Lopez had worn at that year's Grammys, while Stone's pink confection aped the dress Paltrow had won an Oscar in 12 months earlier.</p><p><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong> returned to the Oscars in 2002 in a gothic Alexander McQueen number she hoped would bring "a little bit of punk" to the occasion.</p><p>"I still love the dress but I should have worn a bra," the actress let slip 11 years later.</p><p>More recently, music star <strong>Pharrell Williams</strong> refused to be outflanked at the 2014 ceremony by turning up with wife Helen with a pair of Lanvin shorts.</p><p>By the time he came on stage to perform his Oscar-nominated song Happy, though, he was back in his more familiar casual gear - and hat.</p><p>And then there is <strong>Jenny Beavan,</strong> the British costume designer who Stephen Fry ungallantly likened to "a bag lady" at last year's Bafta Film Awards.</p><p>Undeterred, she rocked up at the Oscars two weeks later in a leather jacket adorned with a flaming skull. "I look ridiculous in frocks," she said later.</p>
