<p>The assailants have shot and killed at least seven Christians in separate attacks in Sinai's El Arish city in February.</p>
<p>At least 90 families have reached the Ismailiya governorate, according to an official of the Coptic Orthodox Church.</p>

<p>"The government helped find housing for some families and we rented apartments for the rest," Father Kyrillos Ibrahim told DPA news agency from Ismailiya on Sunday.</p>
<p>Each of the 90 families includes on average five members, according to him.</p>
<p>"It is hard to estimate if there will be more families coming, it depends how bad the situation is. We hope this is a temporary situation," <span>Ibrahim</span> said.</p>
<h2>Arriving scared</h2>
<p><span>Luggage, boxes of food and newly displaced people were arriving throughout Sunday a</span><span>t Ismailiya's main youth hostel where authorities have put up 45 families.</span></p>
<p>Many rights activists say the displacement is a clear sign the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has failed to provide a minimum of security for Sinai's Coptic Christians.</p>
<p>The government only agreed to put up the fleeing Christians in government housing in Ismailiya after pressure on social media, which they underline as another disturbing sign.</p>
<p>Nabil Shukrallah of Ismailiya's Evangelical Church said the families arrive scared and in need of supplies, which are being stockpiled at the church via donations from several parishes.</p>

<p>They are then transported to be housed in and around the city, in private homes and now also accommodation provided by the government.</p>
<p>"They're exhausted, with urgent needs for food and children's clothing," he said, as one father carried off a sick infant to be evacuated by ambulance.</p>
<p>"They're terrified of the violence and brutality of the terrorists."</p>
<p>Largely desert, the Sinai Peninsula has seen repeated attacks from armed groups, mainly targeting security forces, since the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<h2>ISIL video</h2>
<p>The flight from Sinai has intensified after the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group released a video last week threatening to carry out attacks against Christians in Egypt.</p>
<p>It described Christians as "infidels" empowering the West against Muslims.</p>
<p>The area's few Christians had been trickling out but the departures picked up after fighters killed a Christian plumber at home in front of his family on Thursday in El Arish.</p>

<p>No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. But Egypt's ISIL affiliate is based in north Sinai and in December carried out a suicide bombing against a Cairo church.</p>
<p>The Cairo church bombing and the recent killings point to a shift in ISIL's tactics in Egypt, with the group now also attacking Christian targets that are less protected than military installations.</p>
<p>Before Egypt's 2011 Arab Spring uprising, about 5,000 Christians lived in northern Sinai, but the number has since dwindled to fewer than 1,000, say priests and residents.</p>
<p>Egypt does not keep official statistics on the number of Christians in cities or across the country.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
