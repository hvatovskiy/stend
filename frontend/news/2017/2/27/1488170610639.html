<p><span>Staffan de Mistura, the</span> UN special envoy for Syria, says the attacks were a deliberate attempt to derail negotiations and he urged both sides to remain committed to the political process.</p>
<p>At least 42 people died in Homs when suicide blasts targeted military and intelligence buildings.</p>
<p>The government delegation says anyone who fails to condemn the attack is an "accomplice to terrorism".</p>
<p>But they are staying in Geneva and will meet de Mistura again on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Opposition negotiators also condemned the attack and said they would attend more talks this week.</p>
<p>But is a political settlement possible without involving all the armed groups?</p>
