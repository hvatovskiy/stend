<p>Inside the Erbil-based headquarters of Rudaw, a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/media.html">media</a> group in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, photos and bouquet of flowers were placed at Gardi's empty desk. </p>
<p>"Shifa was not only a smart journalist, but also a very serious and loyal person," Ako Mohammed, executive director of Rudaw, was quoted as telling a crowd who had gathered to pay respect to her body outside the network's offices on Saturday. </p>
<h2>Danger for journalists</h2>
<p>The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said Gardi's death "underscores the continuing risk the journalists in <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iraq.html">Iraq</a> face while doing their jobs".</p>
<p><span> Robert Mahoney, the </span>CPJ deputy executive director, said journalists covering the conflict in Iraq "have shown remarkable bravery and commitment to their work, and all sides in the conflict should honour that commitment by ensuring that they can do their jobs safely".</p>
<p>Namo Abdulla, Washington bureau chief of Rudaw, wrote on social media that the slain journalist was a "great friend and colleague". </p>

<p>Gardi's cameraman, Younis Mustafa, was also wounded in Saturday's blast.</p>
<p>Gardi was presenting a daily special programme on the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/iraqi-forces-launch-offensive-retake-west-mosul-170219045120508.html" target="_self">Mosul offensive</a>.</p>

The military operation to retake Iraq's second-largest city from ISIL was launched in October last year, and in January its eastern half was declared <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/haider-al-abadi-east-mosul-fully-liberated-isil-170124181328309.html" target="_self"> "fully liberated". </a></p>
<p>Mosul is ISIL's last major urban stronghold in Iraq, but the battle to retake its <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/army-claims-gains-fight-western-mosul-170224084226033.html" target="_self">western half</a> is expected to be the most challenging yet, since the streets are older, narrower and it is densely populated with an estimated 750,000 civilians trapped in the area.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
