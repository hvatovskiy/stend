<p>Bill payers switched providers 7.7 million times, saving potentially more than Â£200 a year, according to Ofgem.</p><p>However, looming price rises by some of the UK's biggest suppliers would test how competitive the market was, the regulator said.</p><p>Firms were not doing enough for about two thirds of customers, Ofgem added.</p><p>In the coming weeks, standard gas and electricity tariffs will go up at Npower, Scottish Power, Co-operative Energy and First Utility, while EDF will raise electricity prices.</p><p>Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said the increase in customer switching should act as a "warning" to such suppliers.</p><p>"If they fail to keep prices under control or do not provide a good service, they risk being punished as customers vote with their feet," Mr Nolan said.  </p><p>"While today's figures show good progress, the market is not as competitive as we would like."</p><p>About two thirds of energy customers remain on standard tariffs or pre-payment deals, which often offer far worse value, the regulator said.</p><p>Despite intense competition, multiple government and consumer group initiatives and soaring fuel bills, not enough people switch suppliers with any regularity.  </p><p>Last year saw 7.7 million switches - but that's not 7.7 million households, since some people change gas or electricity providers separately.</p><p>It is progress, though. As ever the easier and quicker it is to switch the more of it will occur. </p><p>Small and medium-sized firms have put great store on the full roll-out of smart meters, which they hope will allow customers to switch in 23 hours, rather than the 21 days it still takes.  </p><p>Half of households have never switched suppliers, proving that you can lead a horse to water....</p><p>Claire Osborne, energy expert at price comparison site uSwitch, said many customers could guard against bill hikes by swapping providers. </p><p>By shopping around and switching to a fixed deal, they could "protect against any more unwelcome price rises", she added.</p><p>It now takes three weeks to switch suppliers, down from five weeks three years ago, according to Ofgem. </p><p>Customer complaints about switching dropped 36% last year, suggesting companies are also managing the process better, the Energy Ombudsman said. </p><p>Lawrence Slade, chief executive of the trade association Energy UK, said the high rate of swapping showed "competition was working for more and more households".</p><p>"The industry is committed to ensuring the market works for everyone and is taking action to engage with loyal customers," he said.</p><p>Last week, British Gas, which is freezing gas and electricity prices until August, said it was facing strong competition from more than 50 suppliers.</p>
