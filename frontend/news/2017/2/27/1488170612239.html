<p>Gardi was presenting a daily special programme on the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/iraqi-forces-launch-offensive-retake-west-mosul-170219045120508.html">Mosul offensive</a>.</p>
<p>On February 21, Gardi saved a wounded rabbit in the village of Albu Saif, Rudaw said, citing the moment she returned to the newsroom with the animal in her arms.</p>
<p>The military operation to retake Iraq's second-largest city from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group was officially launched in October last year, and in January its eastern half was declared "<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/haider-al-abadi-east-mosul-fully-liberated-isil-170124181328309.html">fully liberated</a>".</p>
<p>A number of journalists have been injured in the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/battle-mosul.html">Mosul operation</a>. In October, an Iraqi television journalist was killed covering the battle.</p>
<p>Mosul is ISIL's last major urban stronghold in <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iraq.html">Iraq</a>, but the battle to retake its <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/army-claims-gains-fight-western-mosul-170224084226033.html">western half</a> is expected to be the most challenging yet, since the streets are older, narrower and it is densely populated with an estimated 750,000 civilians trapped in the area.</p>
