<p>Yacoub Shaheen, the 23-year-old son of a Syriac Christian carpenter, on Saturday night won the pan-Arab singing competition, defeating a fellow Palestinian and a Yemeni in the finals filmed in Lebanon.</p>
<p>He became the second Palestinian to win the contest after <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/08/20138134222260693.html">Mohammed Assaf</a>, who was raised in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, won Arab Idol against all odds aged 23 in 2013.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people, including the town mayor, gathered in front of a large screen in Bethlehem's Manger Square to watch Shaheen sing in the final of the popular television show.</p>

<p><span>Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith, reporting from Bethlehem, said: </span><span>"Arab Idol is the most watched TV programme across the Middle East and North Africa."</span></p>
<p>Supporters celebrated all night after Shaheen won, waving Palestinian flags and emblems of the Christian Syriac church.</p>
<p>His mother, Norma Shaheen, thanked the crowd after public vote results came in.</p>
<p>"Yacoub won with his voice, his education, his good manners, as well as his love for his people, Bethlehem and Palestine," she said.</p>
<p><span>In Beirut, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas recent met Shaheen and fellow finalist Amir Dandan, 25, a Palestinian citizen of Israel descended from the Arabs who remained on their land when Israel was established in 1948.</span></p>
<p class="ReadMoreContentSeparator"><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/08/20138134222260693.html" target="_self"> READ MORE: Arab Idol winner Mohammed Assaf - 'No one will politicise me</a><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/08/20138134222260693.html" target="_self">'</a><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/08/20138134222260693.html" target="_self"> </a></p>
<p>Dandan's supporters also feted him in his hometown of Majd al-Krum in northern Israel, gathering in a stadium to support the singer who has lived in the US for several years.</p>
<p>This year, four of the 25 contestants taking part in Arab Idol were Palestinian or Palestinian citizen of Israel, the highest participation for Palestinians in four seasons of the show.</p>
<p>Assaf became a symbol of Palestinian resilience when he won in 2013, inspiring two-time Oscar nominee Hany Abu-Assad to direct a feature film about him.</p>
<p>"Assaf is now one of the biggest stars in the region. Yacoub will now also have to adjust to life as a Palestinian celebrtiy," Al Jazeera's Smith said.</p>
