      </p></section><div id="article-body" class="article-body"><p>Around 250 anti-fascist protesters gathered in the London borough of Hackney to protest the LD50 art gallery and its showcasing of works by far-right creators.</p>
<p>The protest on Saturday near the inconspicuous-looking building in the heart of the British capital was the latest escalation in a growing campaign against the gallery's curator, Lucia Diego.</p>
<p>"We condemn businesses such as LD50 which promote and give a platform to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/racism.html">racism</a>, xenophobia and hate speech," said Hackney's mayor, Philip Glanville, in a statement delivered to the protesters.</p>
<p>He added that he had asked the police to look into whether the gallery had broken any laws.</p>
<p>"We should not allow hate to become normalised or acceptable.</p>
<p>Anger at Diego has grown over the past week because of the content of the exhibitions at the gallery and her decision to give platform to white supremacist ideologues.</p>

<hr>
<p>Works exhibited at LD50 included images of far-right mascot "Pepe the Frog" in the guise of a southern US plantation owner, images of US President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a>, a memorial to spree killer Elliot Rodger, and other esoteric references to online white supremacist culture.</p>
<p>Last summer, the gallery hosted the "Neoreaction" conference, which featured guests, including American far-right ideologue Brett Stevens, who inspired mass killer Anders Breivik, according to the Norwegian's manifesto published prior to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2011/07/2011722222451150369.html">the attacks</a> in Oslo and Utoya island.</p>
<p>After Breivik's killing of 77 people, mainly teenagers at a summer camp, <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2011/07/26/american-blogger-praises-oslo-shooter" target="_blank"> Stevens said</a>: "I am honoured to be so mentioned by someone who is clearly far braver than I."</p>
<p>"No comment on his methods, but he chose to act where many of us write, think and dream," he added further.</p>
<p>Local anti-fascist activist Sasha Simic, who attended Saturday's protest, told Al Jazeera information about the gallery's conduct only came out during the past week and was unexpected given Hackney's multicultural character.</p>
<div class="QuoteContainer">

</div>
<p>"It's come as a bit of shock that in the heart of Dalston (an area in Hackney) that there's a place putting a platform up for these poisonous ideas," he said, adding: "There are very few places in London that are more multicultural than Hackney."</p>
<p>"The thing about Hackney is its diversity. Lots and lots of communities live and work there and that's part of the glory of London."</p>
<p>Diego has denied she is a racist and told local outlet, the Hackney Gazette, that an art gallery needed "to be able to open discourse".</p>
<p>However, Simic dismissed the idea that the works are merely artistic expression as "nonsense, absolute nonsense".</p>
<p>"I think we need to be clear, this woman agrees with the agenda of what's going on, that's been confirmed by her Facebook posts," he said referring to a leaked <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/facebook.html">Facebook</a> conversation involving Diego, where she appears to <a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/34830/1/london-art-gallery-accused-of-having-alt-right-agenda" target="_blank">defend</a> Trump's ban on <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/spotlight/trump-muslims-ban.html">Muslims entering the US</a>.</p>
<p>"I don't like using the term alt-right, I prefer to use the more accurate label of 'fascist', but she has clear fascist sympathies.</p>
<p>"There is no artistic right for the persecution of other people or for expressing the idea that another group of people are manifestly inferior."</p>
<p>The campaign group 'Shut Down LD50', which is leading the fight against Diego, also accuses her of leaking the <a class="InternalLink" href="https://shutdownld50.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"> identities of her critics </a>to far-right organisations.</p>
<p>Until Friday - when the post was deleted - the gallery's website published screenshots of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/social-media.html">social media</a> posts made by its critics on its front page.</p>
<p>Diego also recommended journalists seeking more information contact an openly racist <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/twitter.html">Twitter</a> account for comment, <a href="http://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/news/politics/ld50_owner_says_funny_alt_right_twitter_account_had_done_press_for_her_dalston_gallery_1_4905827" target="_blank"> later telling </a>the Hackney Gazette, that she did so because it was "funny".</p>

<hr>
<p>In an email response to Al Jazeera regarding some of the allegations, Diego said Facebook conversations were made public by a fellow artist in order to "shame" her publicly.</p>
<p>On her stance on Trump's Muslim ban she said her comments were directed at how artists had reacted to the US leader's election.</p>
<p>"(I meant) I'm tired of seeing the 'art crowd' jumping/protesting against Trump at every given opportunity without a minute of consideration, just by default - so the comment was directed more towards this behaviour than anything else."</p>
<p>Teeside University's Nigel Copsey, a leading expert on fascism and anti-fascism, said there was no academic justification for showcasing far-right works that were detached from their critical context.</p>
<p>However, he warned the protest movement that has built up against LD50 could unintentionally give it publicity.</p>
<p>"Should far-right creative work be 'celebrated'? There is no educative value if the work is not critically contextualised," he said.</p>
<p>"In this case, the publicity that this generates gives this obscure gallery far more attention than it so obviously deserves."</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">UK</a> has seen a number of anti-fascist protests since the election of Trump.</p>
<p>An online sub-culture of white supremacists, known as the alt-right, has grown in popularity across North America and <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/europe.html">Europe</a> in recent years and strongly backs the US president's policies targeting immigrants and Muslims.</p>
