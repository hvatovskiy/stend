<p>While many know it as a lawless jungle region producing about 70 percent of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/peru.html">Peru</a>'s cocaine, few are aware of its vibrant local traditions including motor-rickshaw racing.</p>
<p>Like Omar, many young coca farmers escape from the fields to compete in huge races, attended by thousands of spectators.</p>
<p>The biggest race of the year is coming up and Omar has decided to overstay his military leave to participate, working on his family's coca farm to earn the money needed to soup up his bike.</p>
<p><span>He knows he will be in big trouble when he eventually returns to the army. But for Omar, racing brings a deep sense of pride in representing his community and it's all worth it for the chance of winning.</span></p>
