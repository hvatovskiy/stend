      <div class="ArticleCorrection"><span>CORRECTION: </span>27/02/2017: A previous headline of this article mistakenly identified the detained opposition leader as Almazbek Atambayev. The held politician is Omurbek Tekebayev.</div><p>Authorities in <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/kyrgyzstan.html">Kyrgyzstan</a> have detained a prominent opposition leader on charges of fraud and <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/corruption.html">corruption</a>, claims that his supporters say are politically motivated in advance of a presidential poll.</p>
<p><span><span><span>Omurbek </span>Tekebayev, leader of the nominally socialist Ata Meken (Fatherland) party and o<span>ne of the most outspoken critics of President Almazbek Atambayev</span>, was detained on Sunday after landing at Bishkek airport from the Austrian capital, Vienna.</span></span></p>
<p>In a statement, the prosecutor general's office said it suspected Tekebayev, 58, of taking a $1m bribe from a Russian investor in 2010.</p>
<p>Tekebayev, who was then a senior member of the provisional government, promised the investor he would be able to take over a local telecommunications company, prosecutors said.</p>

<p><span>Hundreds of supporters held demonstrations to protest the arrest across the country as it</span><span> may eliminate him as a contender for the upcoming </span><span>presidential election on November 19.</span></p>
<p><span>About 300 people gathered in front of the State Committee for National Security (GKNB) in Bishkek, calling for his release.</span></p>
<p><span>"The detention of the famous politician Tekebayev at night in the airport looks like the detention of a terrorist," said former Kyrgyz President Roza Otunbayeva.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Members of <span>Tekebayev's Ata Meken faction</span> at the protest said his arrest was illegal due to procedural violations.</span></span></p>
<h2><strong>'Denies wrongdoing'</strong></h2>
<p>Kanybek Imanaliyev, a member of parliament who belongs to Ata Meken, said he denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>"He considers his detention... unwarranted and illegal and a continuation of political repressions," Imanaliyev said.</p>
<p>"We planned to hold a party congress within a month and nominate him as candidate (for presidency)."</p>
<p><span><span>Atambayev, whose term ends this year, c</span></span>annot run for re-election under the Kyrgyz constitution, but his allies in parliament successfully pushed through a referendum on a package of amendments significantly boosting the powers of the prime minister.</p>
<p>This has prompted speculation the president may either become a powerful cabinet head - although Atambayev denies having such plans - or install a loyal figure as prime minister in order to retain power in the country of six million.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
