<p>Chanel's creative director accused Streep of rejecting one of his dresses because she found a different designer who was willing to pay her.</p><p>He has since said he "misunderstood" - but that has not calmed Streep's ire.</p><p>"I do not take this lightly, and Mr Lagerfeld's generic 'statement' of regret for this 'controversy' was not an apology," she said.</p><p>She also criticised <a href="http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/karl-lagerfeld-chanel-meryl-streep-passed-on-oscar-dress-when-chanel-oscar-dress-10817502/" class="story-body__link-external">fashion website WWD</a>, which originally reported his quotes.</p><p>"He lied, they printed the lie, and I am still waiting," she said in a statement.</p><p>The dispute began when WWD published an interview in which Lagerfeld said he had started work on a dress for Streep to wear to Sunday's Academy Awards.</p><p>But he claimed he was then told by one of the actress's representatives: "Don't continue the dress. We found somebody who will pay us."</p><p>Referring to Streep, he said: "A genius actress, but cheapness also, no?"</p><p>The designer later issued a statement admitting he had "misunderstood that Ms Streep may have chosen another designer due to remuneration" and said he regretted the controversy.</p><p>However, Streep, who has her 20th Oscar nomination this year for Florence Foster Jenkins, hit back.</p><p>She said Lagerfeld "defamed me, my stylist and the illustrious designer whose dress I chose to wear, in an important industry publication".</p><p>Her statement added: "The story was picked up globally, and continues, globally, to overwhelm my appearance at the Oscars, on the occasion of my record-breaking 20th nomination, and to eclipse this honour in the eyes of the media, my colleagues and the audience."</p>
