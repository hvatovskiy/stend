<p>Ali al-Zaatari, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Syria, warned of dire conditions in Zabadani, Madaya, Fua and Kefraya; towns besieged by government troops and the Lebanese armed group <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/hezbollah.html">Hezbollah</a>.</p>

<p>"Sixty-thousand innocent people are trapped there in a cycle of daily violence and deprivation, where malnutrition and lack of proper medical care prevail," he said in a statement released late on Monday.</p>
<p>"The situation is a looming <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/humanitarian-crises.html">humanitarian catastrophe</a>. The principle of free access to people in need must be implemented now and without repeated requests."</p>
<p>Zaatari added that the situation was complicated by the "tit-for-tat arrangement" between the towns, whereby no aid can be provided to Madaya and Zabadani without similar access to Fua and Kefraya, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The linkage "makes humanitarian access prone to painstaking negotiations that are not based on humanitarian principles", he said.</p>
<p>"This has prevented medical cases from receiving proper treatment and evacuation. People are in need, and they cannot wait any longer. We need to act now."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/aleppo-161218045722651.html">Fua and Kefraya, the last two government-held villages</a> in Idlib province, are surrounded by a rebel alliance including Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/al-qaeda.html">al-Qaeda</a>'s Syrian branch).</p>
<p>The UN's last humanitarian access to the four towns was in November, the statement said, without directing blame for the lack of access on one side or the other.</p>
<h2>'One million under siege'</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, the UN said it had been able to deliver aid to just 40,000 people in besieged and hard-to-reach areas in January, despite requesting access to more than 900,000 people.</p>
<p>That made January the worst month for humanitarian deliveries in nearly a year, with approval received for just one of 21 humanitarian convoys proposed by the UN, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent.</p>
<p>According to Siege Watch, a monitoring group that tracks besieged communities, more than one million Syrians live under siege in Damascus governorate, Idlib governorate, Homs and Deir Az Zor.</p>
