<p>Hours later, three Indian soldiers were killed in a gun battle with suspected rebels in India-administered Kashmir.</p>
<p>One suspected rebel also died in the clash in Bandipora district, the Indian army's Northern Command said.</p>
<h2>Renewed violence</h2>
<p>Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since they won independence from Britain in 1947. Both claim the territory in its entirety.</p>
<p>Several rebel groups have for decades fought the 500,000 Indian troops deployed in the region, demanding independence or a merger of the territory with Pakistan.</p>
<p>The fighting has left tens of thousands, mostly civilians, dead.</p>

<p>The latest violence came three days after four suspected rebels, a civilian and three soldiers, were <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/india-army-kills-suspected-rebels-kashmir-170212080349706.html">killed</a> in south Kashmir, sparking pro-independence demonstrations that were put down with live ammunition and pellet guns, wounding more than two dozen people.</p>
<p>The disputed region has seen renewed protests and attacks following the killing of a popular rebel commander in July last year.</p>
<p>At least 100 civilians have been killed in the subsequent crackdown, according to health officials.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
