<p>It's not long until he starts giggling, as the familiar voice of a woman with a thick French accent blasts through the speakers.</p>
<p>For five minutes every day, <span>Moudou Moudou, a satirical character created by <span>Senegalese comedian Marieme Faye, takes over the Vibe Radio airwaves - and Diallo is just one of many who tune in religiously. </span></span></p>

<p><span>"She pokes fun at everyone; politicians as well as regular people," <span>Diallo says.</span> </span></p>
<p><span>"With comedy, she says out loud what people think, things that would never be published in a newspaper."</span></p>
<p>Through her character, a migrant who returned home with a fresh perspective on her home country, Faye uses radio comedy to address politics and social taboos.</p>
<p><span><span>"Comedy is a window to communication," <span>Faye says.</span> </span></span>"It's a good way to touch people without offending them." </p>

<p>She describes her character as white on the inside and black on the outside.</p>
<p>On Valentine's Day, she challenges dating rituals, such as paying for dinner in exchange for love. She also delves into criticising polygamy, a common practice in the country.</p>
<p>Faye says the practice has nothing to do with religion - all with good humour.</p>
<p>"We talk about serious topics, but I make them laugh and when they laugh they have an opportunity to reflect on serious issues," she says.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera News</span></p>
