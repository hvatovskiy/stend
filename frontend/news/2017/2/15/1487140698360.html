<p>At least 39 women were among the victims killed amid the violence between February 9 and 13, the UN's <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/human_rights.html">human rights</a> spokeswoman Liz Throssell said on Thursday, citing sources in the country.</p>
<p>The soldiers fired indiscriminately with machine guns when they saw the fighters, who were armed mainly with machetes and spears, she said.</p>
<p>"We are deeply concerned at the reported high number of deaths, which, if confirmed, would suggest excessive and disproportionate use of force by the soldiers," she said.</p>

<p>The violence is also part of a broader surge in instability across Congo in recent weeks after President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/joseph-kabila.html">Joseph Kabila</a> refused to step down when his constitutional mandate<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2016/10/drc-president-clinging-power-161019183719079.html"> expired in December</a>.</p>
<p>At least 11 people were killed on Monday in clashes between the army and a group loyal to a traditional chief slain in fighting with police last year, said local activist <span>Jean Rene Tshimanga, president of the Civil Society of Kasai-Central province</span>.</p>
<p>"This morning, we learned again that [the group] attacked the men in uniform [who] repelled them," Tshimanga told Reuters news agency. He did not know how many of the dead were fighters and how many army soldiers.</p>
<p>Neither provincial nor military officials could be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>Similar clashes have uprooted tens of thousands.</p>
<p>Analysts say violence in Congo, a tinderbox of conflicts linked to land, ethnicity and mineral resources, has been exacerbated by Kabila's <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/gunfire-drc-capital-tension-grows-kabila-161220074221948.html">failure to step down</a>.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Congo's UN peacekeeping mission said Kamwina Nsapu had committed violent atrocities and used child soldiers, and it also criticised the army for what it said was a disproportionate use of force against the militia fighters, who are typically only lightly armed.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Reuters news agency</span></p>
