<p>The National Cyber Security Centre - part of intelligence agency GCHQ - started work in October as part of a £1.9bn five-year strategy.</p><p>Staff in Victoria, central London, will be joined by experts from the private sector to help identify threats.</p><p>NCSC chief Ciaran Martin said: "We want to make the UK the hardest target".</p><p>The secondments to the centre by 100 private sector employees will be funded by their own companies.</p><p>Announcing the initiative, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the "best and the brightest in industry" will help "test and to challenge the government's thinking" in cyber security.</p><p>He added: "Government cannot protect business and the general public from the risks of cyber-attack on its own. It has to be a team effort. It is only in this way that we can stay one step ahead of the scale and pace of the threat that we face."</p><p>There were 188 cyber attacks classed by the NCSC as Category Two or Three during the last three months. </p><p>And even though the UK has not experienced a Category One attack - the highest level, an example of which would have been<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-33017310" class="story-body__link"> the theft of confidential details</a> of millions of Americans from the Office of Personnel Management - there is no air of complacency at the NCSC's new headquarters.  </p><p>Ciaran Martin, the centre's chief executive, told the BBC: "We have had significant losses of personal data, significant intrusions by hostile state actors, significant reconnaissance against critical national infrastructure - and our job is to make sure we deal with it in the most effective way possible." </p><p>As well as protecting against and responding to high-end attacks on government and business, the NCSC also aims to protect the economy and wider society. </p><p>The UK is one of the most digitally dependent economies, with the digital sector estimated to be worth over £118bn per year - which means the country has much to lose. </p><p>It is not just a crippling cyber-attack on infrastructure that could turn out the lights which worries officials, but also a loss of confidence in the digital economy from consumers and businesses, as a result of criminals exploiting online vulnerabilities.  </p><p>A sustained effort was required by government and private sector working together to make the UK the hardest possible target, officials say.</p><p>Russia has been the focus of recent concern, following claims it used cyber-attacks to interfere with the recent US presidential election. </p><p>"I think there has been a significant change in the Russian approach to cyber-attacks and the willingness to carry it out, and clearly that's something we need to be prepared to deal with," Mr Martin said. </p><p>French and German officials have warned of the possibility of interference in their upcoming elections, but the NCSC's head said there was no evidence that a significant attack or compromise had yet taken place against the UK democratic process.  </p><p>"There has been an identifiable trend in Russian attacks in the West, in terms of focusing on critical national industries and political and democratic processes," Mr Martin added.</p><p>"And so it follows from that that we will look to be sure we are protecting those sectors in the UK as well as we possibly can." </p><p>The centre will be working on a voluntary basis with political parties and giving advice to high-profile individuals - including MPs - on how to protect their sensitive data.</p><p>The UK is already targeting computers in other countries being used for cyber-attack, particularly if there is no possibility of prosecution or for co-operation with authorities where the hackers are based. </p><p>"In the most serious cases, we have lawful powers where we can go after the infrastructure of adversaries - the infrastructure that people use to attack us - and we would do that in some of the most serious cases several dozen times a year," Mr Martin said.</p><p>In the past, UK cyber protection was largely situated within GCHQ in Cheltenham, which was criticised by businesses and others as overly secretive. </p><p>The NCSC aims to be more public facing and accessible. It will also protect a far wider range of sectors, rather than just government and national security-related industries, like defence. </p><p>GCHQ will still be the parent body for the NCSC, meaning it can draw on the intelligence agency's skills and capabilities. </p><p>Sometimes, the intelligence arm of GCHQ spots compromised networks as it watches adversaries move across the internet. </p><p>It was through this type of work that GCHQ spotted the compromise of the US Democratic Party's information by Russian hackers, which it then informed US authorities about.</p><p>The NCSC is working on trial services to pro-actively discover vulnerabilities in public sector websites, help government departments better manage spoofing of their email, and take down tens of thousands of phishing sites affecting the UK.   </p><p>"We're actively working to reduce the harm caused by cyber-attacks against the UK and will use the government as a guinea pig for all the measures we want to see done by industry at national scale," says the NCSC technical director, Dr Ian Levy. </p>
