<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, replying to a question on a daily conference call, said on Tuesday that charges made a day ago by Macron's party chief, Richard Ferrand, were absurd.</p>
<p>"We did not have and do not have any intention of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, or in their electoral processes in particular," Peskov told reporters.</p>

<p>He said that there was a hysterical campaign against Russian President Vladimir Putin in certain countries abroad.</p>
<p>Ferrand said on Monday that the French centrist politician, who leads the opinion polls for the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2017/02/marine-le-pen-win-french-presidential-election-170206181301233.html">vote in May</a>, had become a "fake news" target of Russian media and that his campaign was facing thousands of internet attacks.</p>
<p>Macron’s party chief also said that Moscow looked favourably on the policies of far-right leader Marine Le Pen and centre-right candidate Francois Fillon, who are election rivals of Macron. He added that both had been "mysteriously spared" from Russian media criticism.</p>
<p>Macron's strong pro-Europe stance was not to Russia's liking, however, he said.</p>
<p>Le Pen, who heads the National Front and is Macron's closest competitor in the race for the Elysee, wants to take France out of the EU and supports Russia's policy on Ukraine.</p>
<h2>French media accussed</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, Ferrand renewed those charges, saying that the databases and email boxes of Macron's En Marche! (Onwards) party were under attack.</p>
<p>"If these attacks succeeded, the campaign of En Marche would become extremely difficult, if not impossible," Ferrand said in Le Monde online.</p>

<p></p>
<p>He said about half of those thousands of attacks came mainly from Ukraine and had been organised and coordinated by a "structured group" and not by lone hackers.</p>
<p>Ferrand again pointed the finger at Russian state-controlled media Russia Today and Sputnik, saying they were spreading "the most defamatory" rumours about Macron, including some relating to his private life and the financing of his campaign.</p>
<p>Both Russia Today and Sputnik have denied spreading “fake news” about Macron and say Ferrand's allegations are unfounded.</p>
<p>Sputnik, in a comment on Tuesday, said Ferrand's accusations were false and lacked any evidence, and represented an attempt at spinning public opinion.</p>
