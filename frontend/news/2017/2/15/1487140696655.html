<p>Police conducted simultaneous raids in 37 different provinces and taken 834 people into custody, state-run Anadolu Agency quoted police forces as saying on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Anadolu said authorities received intelligence that the outlawed <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/pkk.html">Kurdistan Workers' Party</a> (PKK) would escalate attacks after February 15, the day marking the 1999 capture of imprisoned PKK leader, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/03/201332114565201776.html">Abdullah Ocalan</a>.</p>
<p><span>Along with the suspects, two Kalashnikovs, 11 guns, 15 rifles and ammunition were seized, police said.</span></p>
<p>The operations come as Turks prepare to vote on April 16 on replacing the parliamentary system with the stronger presidency sought by President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a>.</p>

<p>The referendum will be held under a state of emergency imposed after an <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/turkey-attempted-coup.html">attempted coup</a> last July.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people have been arrested since the abortive coup over suspected ties to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/fethullah-gulen.html">Fethullah Gulen</a>, the US-based Muslim leader and businessman accused by Ankara of organising the coup.</p>
<h2>HDP reaction</h2>
<p>The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) said the raids aimed to weaken it. </p>
<p>"The basic goal of these operations ... is to hold the referendum without the HDP," a statement from its executive committee said.</p>

<p>Its statement, released before Tuesday's arrests, said more than 300 of its <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/turkey-arrests-pro-kurdish-opposition-leaders-161104141452597.html">members and executives</a> had been detained on Monday, bringing those held this year to around 1,200.</p>
<p>A dozen of its MPs and tens of Kurdish mayors from a sister party have been jailed pending trial.</p>
<p>The government accuses the HDP, parliament's second biggest opposition party, of being a political extension of the PKK.</p>
<p>The HDP denies direct links with the PKK and says it wants a peaceful settlement in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast.</p>
<p>The PKK, designated a "terrorist" group by <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/turkey.html">Turkey</a>, the EU and the US, launched an armed struggle against the Turkish state in 1984 and more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.</p>
<p>A ceasefire between the PKK and the state broke down in July 2015 and thousands have been killed in the conflict since then.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
