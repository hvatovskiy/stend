<p>The research, the first of its kind, follows anecdotal reports that players who head heavy balls may be more prone to developing dementia later in life.</p><p>The Football Association says it will look at this area more closely. </p><p>But experts said recreational players were unlikely to incur problems. </p><p>The small study is published in the journal Acta Neuropathologica. </p><p>Researchers from University College London and Cardiff University examined the brains of five people who had been professional footballers and one who had been a committed amateur throughout his life.  </p><p>They had played football for an average of 26 years and all six went on to develop dementia in their 60s.</p><p>While performing post mortem examinations, scientists found signs of brain injury - called <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-traumatic-encephalopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx" class="story-body__link-external">chronic traumatic encephalopathy</a> (CTE) in four cases. </p><p>CTE has been linked to memory loss, depression and dementia and has been seen in other contact sports. </p><p>Prof Huw Morris, of University College London, told the BBC: "When we examined their brains at autopsy we saw the sorts of changes that are seen in ex-boxers, the changes that are often associated with repeated brain injury which are known as CTE.</p><p>"So really for the first time in a series of players we have shown that there is evidence that head injury has occurred earlier in their life which presumably has some impact on them developing dementia."</p><p>The report's authors make it clear they were not analysing the risks of heading by children.</p><p>The inquest of ex-England player Jeff Astle, who died in 2002, found that repeatedly heading heavy leather footballs had contributed to trauma to his brain.</p><p>His family have been campaigning for further research. </p><p>Mr Astle's widow, Laraine, from Netherseal in Derbyshire, said: "We've been saying this for 15 years [since Jeff died]. His inquest said he died of industrial disease.</p><p>"It is disgraceful nothing concrete has been done since by the FA or the PFA.</p><p>"It's all about informed choice. On the back of a cigarette packet, smokers can read about risks to their health.</p><p>"Football has been trying to bury its head in the sand and not admit that the game can be a killer."</p><p>The couple's daughter Dawn set up the Jeff Astle Foundation with her mother and sister, to campaign for further research. She is calling for more donors to donate their brains.</p><p>"We know what's happened in America with the dedicated brain bank of former American footballers. </p><p>"It is vitally important that we can get a similar thing here, and get current footballers or families of footballers to pledge the brain.</p><p>"If we hadn't donated dad's brain, we wouldn't know what we know now. We wouldn't know what had killed him."</p><p>But the science is far from clear-cut. </p><p>Each brain also showed signs of Alzheimer's disease and some had blood vessel changes that can also lead to dementia. </p><p>Researchers speculate that it was a combination of factors that contributed to dementia in these players.</p><p>But they acknowledge their research cannot definitively prove a link between football and dementia and are calling for larger studies to look at footballers' long-term brain health.</p><p>Dr David Reynolds, at the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "The causes of dementia are complex and it is likely that the condition is caused by a combination of age, lifestyle and genetic factors. </p><p>"Further research is needed to shed light on how lifestyle factors such as playing sport may alter dementia risk, and how this sits in the context of the well-established benefits of being physically active."</p><p>He added that for people who are recreational footballers, football injuries are unlikely to cause long-term problems and he pointed to expert advice that the benefit of exercise is likely to outweigh the risks.   </p><p>A number of previous cases involving boxers and American footballers have suggested that repetitive blows can cause long-lasting and progressive brain damage.</p><p>But until now there have only been a few case reports of individual footballers with CTE in the UK and the extent of the issue is still unknown. </p><p>The Football Association welcomed the study and said research was particularly needed to find out whether degenerative brain disease is more common in ex-footballers. </p>
