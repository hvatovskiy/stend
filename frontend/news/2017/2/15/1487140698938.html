<p>The loss after tax contrasted with a slender profit of $105m in 2015, the company said in a results statement.</p>
<p>Rolls took a vast hit from the drop in the value of the pound in the wake of Britain's shock EU exit referendum, alongside a $836m penalty to settle bribery allegations.</p>
<p>The London-listed company, whose engines are used in Airbus and <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2014/09/boeing-dreamliner-numbers-201497124552197316.html">Boeing aircraft</a>, added that underlying pre-tax profits almost halved to $1bn.</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce, which also makes power systems for use on land and at sea, stated it was on track with efforts to slash costs and expected a "modest" performance improvement in 2017.</p>

<p>"2016 has been an important year as we accelerated the transformation of Rolls-Royce," said chief executive Warren East, who has overseen a radical restructuring.</p>
<p>"We have made operational progress and performed ahead of our expectations for the year as a whole.</p>
<p>"At the same time, we have delivered major changes to our management and processes and, while we have made good progress in our cost-cutting and efficiency programmes, more needs to be done to ensure we drive sustainable margin improvements within the business."</p>
<p>The huge annual loss also follows a tough past few years for Rolls, which faced a string of profit warnings on the back of weak demand in its aerospace and marine markets.</p>
<p>The company was fined $768m in January to settle bribery and <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/corruption.html">corruption</a> claims probed by Britain's Serious Fraud Office and authorities in <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/brazil.html">Brazil</a> and the United States.</p>
<p>Rolls will pay the penalty over five years but has taken the full cost as an impairment charge against its 2016 profits.</p>
<h2>Pound slump</h2>
<p>The British pound has meanwhile fallen by almost a fifth against the dollar since the Brexit referendum that was held last June.</p>
<p>The slide is pushing up the costs of imported goods, sending British annual inflation to the highest levels in 2.5 years.</p>
<p>Official data Tuesday showed 12-month consumer price inflation rising to 1.8 percent in January - the highest level since June 2014.</p>
<p>"Surging inflation, in particularly food and fuel prices, are eating into disposable incomes and, in turn, that is starting to hit spending," said ING bank economist James Smith.</p>
<p>"We expect to see further evidence of this in this week's retail sales data."</p>
<p>Looking ahead for Rolls, East told reporters that 2017 would be "challenging" for the embattled group.</p>
<p>"We have to look after the short-term or there won't be a long-term."</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span>Â <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
