<p>Officials in South Korea and Malaysia on Tuesday could not confirm the death of Kim Jong-nam. Malaysian police said a North Korean had been taken sick at Kuala Lumpur International Airport and since died.</p>
<p>A senior security source told Al Jazeera that Malaysian police "strongly" believe the deceased individual was Kim Jong-nam.</p>

<p>In a statement, Malaysian police said the 46-year-old dead man was travelling on a passport under the name Kim Chol.</p>
<p>"Kim Jong-nam has been known to travel using a fake name," Al Jazeera's Florence Looi, reporting from the airport in Kuala Lumpur, said.</p>

<p>She added that the body of the deceased man had been taken to a hospital where an autopsy was being conducted.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, the Yonhap news agency said Kim Jong-nam was killed on Monday morning in Malaysia. It cited <span>a South Korean government source but</span> gave no more details.</p>
<p>TV Chosun, a cable television network, said separately that Kim <span>Jong-nam </span>was poisoned at Kuala Lumpur airport by two women believed to be North Korean operatives, who were at large, citing multiple South Korean government sources.</p>
<p>Kim Jong-nam and Kim Jong-un are both sons of former leader Kim Jong-il, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2006/11/2008525184447420573.html">who died in late 2011</a>, but they had different mothers.</p>
<p>In 2001, Kim Jong-nam was caught at an airport in <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/japan.html">Japan</a> travelling on a fake passport, saying he had wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.</p>
<p>He was known to spend a significant amount of his time outside North Korea, travelling to Hong Kong, Macau and mainland <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/china.html">China</a>.</p>

<p>He said several times over the years that he had no interest in leading his country.</p>
<p>"Personally, I am against third-generation succession," he told Japan's Asahi TV in 2010, before his younger brother had succeeded their father.</p>
<p>"I hope my younger brother will do his best for the sake of North Koreans' prosperous lives."</p>
