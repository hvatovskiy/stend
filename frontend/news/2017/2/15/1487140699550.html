<p>Hundreds of pharmacists were rallying against changes to a drug sale law, outside of the provincial assembly building.</p>
<p>There was a sudden blast.</p>
<p>"That is exactly when the suicide bomber detonated the bomb and we lost Hassan," Saqib Rehman, Hassan's longtime friend, told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>"[Hassan] was the sole breadwinner of his family of 10. He passed away at a very young age. Why was there not enough security to stop cars and bikes from passing by?"</p>

<p><span>At least 13 people were killed in the attack, including s<span>even police officers and six civilians.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Within hours, the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/tehrik-taliban.html">Pakistani Taliban</a> faction Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the blast.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>A spokesman for the group warned in a statement that Monday's bomb was "just the start".</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Pakistanis across the Pubjab province mourned the victims on Tuesday, blaming poor security measures.</span></p>
<p><span>Most of the markets and businesses were closed and lawyers boycotted court proceedings in the provincial capital.</span></p>
<p>Punjab's government declared one day of mourning with the national flag lowered to half-staff at all government buildings.</p>
<p>Lahore residents are "furious" at the armed groups conducting attacks, Rehman said, adding that "people here feel the attacks will increase in the near future".</p>
<p>"If this suicide bomber could conduct an attack this easily, it tells us that we are not safe or protected."</p>
<h2>Poor security</h2>
<p>Monday's attack underlines <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/pakistan.html">Pakistan</a>'s challenges of eliminating armed groups and improving security.</p>
<p>"The attacker was not targeting civilians, he went directly towards the police officials who were negotiating with the protesters," said <span>Arshad Dogar, a crime reporter for The News, a local newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span>Dogar had been covering the rally and was present at the time of the attack.</span></p>
<p>"In a situation like this, where there are about 2,000 people gathered together, the security measures were close to zero," Dogar told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>"No one was being checked. Anyone could come and participate in the rally. The suicide attacker walked in without any hurdles and successfully conducted the attack."</p>

<p>In 2016, Lahore suffered one of Pakistan's deadliest assaults when a suicide attack in a park <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/03/lahore-attack-victims-families-struggle-loss-160328150917992.html">killed more than 70 people</a>, including many children.</p>
<p><span>Jamaat-ul-Ahrar group, which claimed that attack, said it was targeting members of Pakistan's Christian minority who had gathered there</span> to celebrate Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>Jamaat-ul-Ahrar also claimed responsibility for a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/quetta-attack-pakistan-mourns-lawyers-boycott-160809065837053.html" target="_self">bombing at a hospital </a>in Quetta that killed 74 people in August last year.</p>
