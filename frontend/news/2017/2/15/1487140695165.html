<p>The project will initially focus on preparing the human cadres able to achieve scientific breakthrough to facilitate the arrival of humans to the Red Planet over the next decades, the statement said.</p>
<p>It will start with an Emirati scientific team and will be extended to include international scientists and researchers, it added.</p>
<p>The project will focus on developing faster means of transportation from and to the Red Planet.
