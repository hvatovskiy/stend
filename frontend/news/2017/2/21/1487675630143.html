<p>The ruling <span>ZANU-PF </span>party is to spend about $2.5 million on the birthday celebration, local media reports said.</p>
<p><span>Opposition parties condemned the events as a waste of money while "93 percent of Zimbabweans are wallowing in poverty caused by his incompetence and misrule", NewZimbabwe.com reported.</span></p>
<p>Celebrations for <span>the world's oldest national ruler, who has vowed to remain in power, </span>will be held on Saturday at Matobo National Park outside Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second-largest city.</p>
<p>Thousands of officials and supporters of Mugabe's <span>ZANU-PF party are expected to attend.</span></p>

<p>Large game animals are often slaughtered for the occasion.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/02/mugabe-birthday-bash-drought-hit-zimbabwe-province-160227183243591.html">previous years</a>, Mugabe has reportedly been offered elephants, buffalo and impala for the feast.</p>
<h2>'Call to resign must come from party'</h2>
<p>Mugabe has ruled out retiring soon, saying that ZANU-PF officials believe there is no "acceptable" alternative.</p>
<p>"The call to step down must come from my party ... In such circumstances, I will step down," the state-owned Sunday Mail newspaper quoted Mugabe as saying in an interview aired late Monday.</p>
<p>"They want me to stand for elections ... If I feel that I can't do it any more, I will say so to my party so that they relieve me. But for now, I think I can't say so," he said. "The majority of the people feel that there is no replacement, a successor who to them is acceptable.</p>

<p>Mugabe came to power when <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/zimbabwe.html">Zimbabwe</a> won independence in 1980 and his rule has been criticised for repression of dissent, election rigging, and for <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2016/09/zimbabwe-financial-crisis-160911181951867.html">causing the country's economic collapse</a>.</p>
<h2>Health fears</h2>
<p>Several incidents in recent years have highlighted his advanced age - including a fall in February 2015 at Harare airport.</p>
<p>In September of the same year, he read a speech to parliament apparently unaware that he had delivered exactly the same address a month earlier.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/zimbabwe-opposition-leaders-rally-mugabe-160813191232326.html">growing calls to step aside</a>, his party has endorsed him as its candidate for general elections next year, and he remains widely respected as a liberation hero by other African leaders.</p>
<p>On Friday, his 51-year-old wife Grace claimed that Mugabe would be the voters' choice <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/mugabe-92-zimbabweans-replacement-170219114758453.html">even after he dies</a>.</p>
<p>She has promised to use a wheelchair to transport him to election rallies if needed.</p>
<p>Mugabe has avoided naming a successor, and his party is divided between factions hoping to succeed him.</p>

<p>Grace was appointed head of the ruling party's women's wing in a surprise move that could make her a possible successor.</p>
<p>Another leading candidate is Mugabe's vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa.</p>
<p>Last year, security forces brutally quelled a series of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/zimbabwe-police-teargas-anti-mugabe-protesters-160826131239936.html">street protests in Harare</a>, a rare public expression of opposition to Mugabe's regime.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg News, Zimbabwe's <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/zimbabweans-sleep-banks-cash-crisis-worsens-161111191648232.html">economic output</a> has halved since 2000 when many white-owned farms were seized by ZANU-PF supporters, leaving the key agricultural sector in ruins.</p>
