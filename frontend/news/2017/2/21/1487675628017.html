<p>The warning comes a day after government officials and the United Nations <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/famine-declared-part-south-sudan-unity-state-170220081516802.html">declared famine in parts of South Sudan</a>.</p>
<p>In Yemen, where war has been raging for nearly two years, 462,000 <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2017/02/international-community-avert-yemen-famine-170209192836050.html">children are suffering from acute malnutrition</a>, while 450,000 children are severely malnourished in northeast <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/nigeria.html">Nigeria</a>.</p>
<p>FEWS NET, the famine early warning system, said some remote areas of Nigeria's Borno state have been <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/nigeria-400000-children-risk-famine-161201161815578.html">affected by famine</a> since late last year.</p>
<p>The disaster is likely to continue, it said, as aid agencies are unable to reach those in need.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2017/02/drought-somalia-time-running-170213111737077.html">Drought in Somalia</a>, meanwhile, has left 185,000 children on the brink of famine but that figure is expected to reach 270,000 over the next few months, said UNICEF.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/south-sudan.html">South Sudan</a>, more than 270,000 children are malnourished and a famine has <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/famine-declared-part-south-sudan-unity-state-170220081516802.html">just been declared</a> in parts of Unity State, in the north of the country, where 20,000 children live.</p>
<p>Aid agencies only describe a crisis as a famine when at least 20 percent of the population has access to fewer than 2,100 kilocalories of food a day and acute malnutrition affects more than 30 percent of the area's children.</p>
<p>Another reason to declare a famine is when there are two hunger-related deaths per 10,000 people, or four child deaths per 10,000 children every day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/unicef.html">UNICEF</a> director Anthony Lake appealed for quick action.</p>
<p>"We can still save many lives," he said.</p>
<p>UN Security Council ambassadors are due to travel to northern Nigeria, Cameroon, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/chad.html">Chad</a> and Niger next month to draw international attention to the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/humanitarian-crises.html">humanitarian crisis</a> triggered by the conflict with <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/boko-haram.html">Boko Haram</a> fighters.</p>
