<p>Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, from London, took their case to the Court of Appeal following a defeat at the High Court last year.</p><p>They are challenging a ruling that they could not have a civil partnership because they did not meet the legal requirement of being the same sex.</p><p>The couple said they faced discrimination.</p><p>The Civil Partnership Act 2004 - which applies throughout the UK - requires that partners be "two people of the same sex". </p><p>It grants gay couples legal rights similar to those given to married couples.</p><p>The introduction of same-sex marriage - which became legal in England, Wales and Scotland in 2014 - has since given gay couples a choice between that and civil partnership.</p><p>At the High Court, Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan argued that, as a heterosexual couple, they did not have the same choice as gay couples and were therefore discriminated against.</p><p>Ms Steinfeld said: "When we started our legal battle for the right to form a civil partnership three years ago we could never have envisaged the incredible levels of support that would follow. </p><p>"It really is remarkable but it just speaks to the fact that opening civil partnerships is popular, fair and would be good for families and children."</p><p>Kate Stewart and Matthew Cole, 46, decided to get a civil partnership in Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory, in June 2016, after deciding marriage was not for them.</p><p>"It just felt to be a more appropriate way to formalise the recognition of our relationship," said Dr Stewart, from Derby.</p><p>"I have been married before... but Matthew and I didn't feel that marriage reflected our relationship.</p><p>"The institution [of marriage] is very much unequal depending on your religion.</p><p>"We therefore felt it wasn't a status we were comfortable with because it still had hangovers of inequality from the past."</p><p>Dr Stewart, 48, said although they believe marriage is right for some couples, it was about having the choice.</p><p>They wanted recognition of their relationship after 10 years together.</p><p>But their civil partnership is not legally recognised in the UK.</p><p>"We paid for ceremony in pounds, we have a certificate, it was all very British, but as soon as we were back home we didn't have legal recognition," Dr Stewart said.</p><p>"The declaration that we were both each other's partner was quite moving... we were on an equal footing. It was surprisingly touching."</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37834074" class="story-body__link">Why choose civil partnership over marriage?</a></p><p><strong>Are you in a heterosexual relationship and hoping to be able to have a civil partnership?
