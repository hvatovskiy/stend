<p>Churkin collapsed while at work at the Russian mission to the United Nations on Monday morning and was rushed to a Manhattan hospital, apparently suffering from heart problems, diplomatic sources told AFP news agency.</p>
<p>In a statement announcing his death, the foreign ministry in Moscow described him as an "outstanding diplomat".</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin "highly valued the professionalism and diplomatic talent of Vitaly Churkin" and offered condolences, Interfax reported</p>
<p>Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova paid tribute, writing on Facebook: "A great diplomat. An extraordinary personality. An outstanding individual. We have lost someone very dear."</p>
<p>News of his death was met with shock at UN headquarters where Churkin, who would have turned 65 on Tuesday, had been a towering presence for a decade.</p>
<p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Churkin had served "with distinction through some of the most challenging and momentous periods of recent history".</p>
<p>Guterres described him as a "forceful presence on the Security Council", a "uniquely skilled diplomat, a powerful orator with great wit and a man of many talents and interests".</p>
<p>Diplomats at a UN meeting observed a moment of silence and a tribute to him was planned at the Security Council on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Petr Iliichev, <span>Russia's deputy UN ambassador, </span>said Churkin was worked "until his last moments".</p>
<p>"His whole life was dedicated to defending the interests of Russia," Iliichev said. "He was on the frontline ... We've lost a prominent diplomat, a strong negotiator, a wonderful individual, a teacher."</p>

<p>UN spokesman Farhan Haq, who was informed of Churkin's death during a daily briefing, offered his condolences.</p>
<p>"He has been such a regular presence here that I'm actually quite stunned," Haq said.</p>
<h2>Western rift</h2>
<p>A career diplomat born in Moscow who studied English from a young age, Churkin had been UN ambassador since April 2006, after serving as Russian ambassador to Canada and to Belgium.</p>
<p>Recently, relations between Russia and the West have soured, culminating with a major rift over Moscow's support for separatists in east Ukraine and its military intervention in Syria.</p>
<p>In his final months, Churkin clashed repeatedly with then-US ambassador Samantha Power over the bloodshed in Syria's Aleppo, staunchly defending Moscow's view that the Syrian government was waging all-out war against "terrorists".</p>
<p>Russia resorted to its veto six times to block action on Syria.</p>
<p>Power tweeted that she was "devastated" and described Churkin as a "diplomatic maestro" who did all he could to bridge US-Russian differences.</p>

<p>Power's successor, Nikki Haley, who arrived less than a month ago, said Churkin had "showed himself to be a gracious colleague".</p>
<p>"We did not always see things the same way, but he unquestionably advocated his country's positions with great skill," said Haley in a statement.</p>
<p>Francois Delattre, Churkin's French counterpart, said he was "one of the most talented diplomats" and "an exceptional representative of Russia.</p>
<p>Matthew Rycroft, Britain's ambassador to the UN, tweeted that he was "absolutely devastated", describing Churkin as "a diplomatic giant & wonderful character".</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
