<p>The proposals are part of a programme to transform the health service and save money across 44 different areas.</p><p>The BBC found 28 proposals affect hospital care, from full closures to centralising services, such as A&amp;E and stroke care, on fewer sites.</p><p>NHS England argue patients will receive better care in the community to compensate for the hospital cuts.</p><p>The proposals also include the creation of "super" community hubs of GPs, care workers and district nurses, seven-day access to GPs and getting hospital specialists to run clinics in the community.</p><p>The BBC analysis found:</p><p>Overall, a third of the 44 plans look to reduce the number of hospitals providing emergency care, while in another third of areas they have said they will consider moving non-emergency care to fewer sites.</p><p>Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.</p><p><i>Need help finding out which region you are in?

The NHS budget is forecast to rise by about 1% a year above inflation on average during this Parliament - much less than the 4% average the NHS has enjoyed throughout the rest of its history.</p><p>There is a lot of support for the concept of moving care out of hospitals. It is hoped it will help keep people well and living independently in the community.</p><p>NHS England, which is overseeing the plans, said they offer the best hope of improving patient care in a sustainable way.</p><p>"They will allow the NHS to take advantage of new technologies, adopt successful practice more widely, and make practical improvements in areas that we know matter most to patients," a spokeswoman added.</p><p>Jeremy Taylor, chief executive of patient group National Voices, said while the process was "not without flaws", the overall vision had the potential to meet 21st Century needs.</p><p>"More than 70% of the NHS budget is spent on people with at least one long-term condition. This is a severe challenge to a system originally set up to provide reactive care for spells of illness."</p><p>Stroke care in London is now world class - and it is all because some services were shut down.</p><p>The capital's stroke care was overhauled in early 2010. Instead of being spread across 30 hospitals as they used to be, services are now centralised on eight "super sites".</p><p>It has meant patients get fast, 24-hour access to the best care, saving hundreds of lives a year.</p><p>If a stroke is suspected, a patient is immediately taken to one of the eight centres. There they are assessed by a stroke specialist and given a brain scan within 30 minutes of arrival.</p><p>1. Northumberland, Tyne and Wear</p><p>2. West, North and East Cumbria</p><p>3.
