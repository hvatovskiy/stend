<p><span>Simon & Schuster's </span><span>announcement on Monday came hours after the Breitbart editor was disinvited to this year's Conservative Political Action Conference because of past comments about relationships between boys and men.</span></p>
<p><span>In audio from a podcast, <span>Yiannopoulos, 33, can be heard describing sexual consent as "arbitrary and oppressive".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>"In the homosexual world particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men, the sort of coming-of-age relationships, relationships in which those older men have helped those young boys to discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable - and sort of a rock, where they can't speak to their parents," Yiannopoulos is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAg3kLNrcn8" target="_blank">heard</a> saying on the Drunken Peasants podcast.</span></span></p>
<p>Documented on a new video from the podcast makers, he is also heard jokingly defending "priest molestation".</p>
<p>Simon & Schuster and its Threshold Editions imprint said that "after careful consideration" they had pulled the book, which was the subject of intense controversy.</p>

<p>Until Monday, Simon & Schuster had defended the book.</p>
<p><span>In December, the publisher asked</span> readers to "withhold judgment until they have had a chance to read the actual contents of the book".</p>
<p>Yiannopoulos, who was reportedly paid a six-figure advance for the memoir to the tune of around $250,000, was permanently banned by <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/twitter.html">Twitter</a> in July 2016 for racist abuse targeting the Ghostbusters actor Leslie Jones.</p>
<p>Taking to his <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/facebook.html">Facebook</a> page, <span>Yiannopoulos</span> wrote: "They canceled my book." In a later post, he said: "I've gone through worse. This will not defeat me."</p>
<p>"Dangerous" was originally scheduled to come out in March, but Yiannopoulos had pushed back the release to June so he could write about the uprisings during his recent campus tour.</p>
<h2><span><span>'They were fine with his racism'</span><br></span></h2>
<p>More than 100 Simon & Schuster authors had objected to his book deal.</p>
<p>Author Roxane Gay withdrew a planned book with the publisher.</p>
<p>On Monday, she said she would continue her protest and not return to <span>Simon & Schuster.</span></p>
<p>"In cancelling Milo's book contract, Simon & Schuster made a business decision the same way they made a business decision when they decided to publish that man in the first place," she <a href="http://roxanegay.tumblr.com/post/157506508260/all-i-really-need-to-say" target="_blank">said</a>. </p>
<p>"When his comments about pedophilia/pederasty came to light, Simon & Schuster realised it would cost them more money to do business with Milo than he could earn for them.</p>
<p>"They did not finally 'do the right thing' and now we know where their threshold, pun intended, lies. They were fine with his racist and xenophobic and <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/01/sexual-assault-time-trump-170124124914906.html">sexist ideologies</a>. They were fine with his transphobia, anti-Semitism and <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/150223070236749.html">Islamophobia</a>."</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
