<p>Over the next week, every BBC local radio station in England and the Channel Islands is accepting nominations for a local artist (or venue) that changed the course of musical history.</p><p>The winners will be honoured with a plaque on a building where they lived or a venue where they became famous.</p><p>To be considered the nominee must be:</p><p>The candidates will be submitted to The British Plaque Trust - and the 40 recipients will be unveiled on Friday, 9 June as part of BBC Music Day.</p><p>Surprisingly few pop musicians have one - with a notable exception being David Bowie, who is honoured at the location of the photoshoot for The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust in London's West End.</p><p>But who else deserves one? To get you thinking, here are five people and places that could benefit from a blue plaque.</p><p>Long before he could grow that designer stubble, George Michael met Andrew Ridgeley at Bushey Meads school and pop history changed forever.</p><p>Bonding over a love of music, the duo initially formed a five-piece band called The Replacements, who played everything from ska to Beethoven's Fur Elise. </p><p>Their friendship was vital in sustaining George through the whirlwind success of Wham! and eventually giving him the courage to go solo.</p><p>Estimated to be more than 100 million years old, Peak Cavern is undoubtedly the oldest music venue in the UK.</p><p>The natural limestone cavern has hosted gigs by the likes of Richard Hawley, Mystery Jets and The Vaccines, who all benefit from the site's remarkable acoustics.</p><p>Fun fact: It used to be called The Devil's Arse (because of the flatulent sound caused by flood water draining from the cave) but received a more demure name in 1880, so Queen Victoria wouldn't be offended when she visited for a concert. </p><p>While Queen were still a struggling young pop band, Freddie Mercury ran a stall in London's Kensington Market with drummer Roger Taylor.</p><p>They sold clothes and bric-a-brac, as well as a thesis Freddie had written about Jimi Hendrix while attending Ealing College.</p><p>The stall did well enough to fund the band in their early days -  so much so that they kept it going after Queen released their first album.</p><p>Delia Derbyshire is one of the earliest and most influential pioneers of electronic sound. </p><p>Working in a time before synthesisers, samplers and multi-track tape recorders, the musician, assisted by her engineer Dick Mills, created not only the original Dr Who theme but countless other experimental and ground-breaking recordings.</p><p>She was born in Coventry, but was evacuated to Preston, Lancashire, during World War Two. A blue plaque at either of her childhood homes would be a fitting memorial.</p><p>Not the most rock'n'roll of locations, Beachy Head nonetheless deserves its place in music history.</p><p>David Bowie filmed elements of the video for Ashes to Ashes there; and The Cure used it as the backdrop for both Just Like Heaven and Close To Me. </p><p>Industrial noise terrorists Throbbing Gristle used it in the deeply-ironic cover for their album, 20 Jazz Funk Greats; and, most famously of all, it stars in the final scene of The Who's Quadrophenia, where the young Jimmy throws his scooter over the edge of those chalky cliffs.</p><p>To make your suggestion for a musical blue plaque, you can contact your BBC local radio station via email, Twitter or Facebook; or email localmusiclegends@bbc.co.uk. You can also share suggestions on social media using #localmusiclegends.  </p><p>The British Plaque Trust criteria is to commemorate innovative, influential and successful people who have died - but any genre of music is permissible, and significant locations which have played a part in our musical heritage are also eligible.</p><p>The initiative is not a vote - so the final decision on who or what the plaques commemorate, and where they are located, will not be based on the number of suggestions received. </p><p>Nominations close at midnight on Sunday, 26 February.  </p>
