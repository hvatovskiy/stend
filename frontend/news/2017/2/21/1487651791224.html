<p>That is the language of computers. Every clever thing your computer does - make a call, search a database, play a game - comes down to ones and zeroes. </p><p>Actually, it comes down to the presence (one) or absence (zero) of a current in tiny transistors on a semiconductor chip. </p><p>Thankfully, we do not have to program computers in zeroes and ones. </p><p>Microsoft Windows, for example, uses 20GB, or 170 billion ones and zeroes. </p><p>Printed out, the stack of A4 paper would be two and a half miles (4km) high. </p><p>Imagine setting every transistor manually.</p><p>Ignoring how fiddly this would be - transistors measure just billionths of a metre - if it took a second to flip each switch, installing Windows would take 5,000 years.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04b1g3c" class="story-body__link">50 Things That Made the Modern Economy</a> highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world.</p><p>It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

Grace signed up at once.</p><p>If you are wondering why the navy needs mathematicians, consider aiming a missile. </p><p>At what angle and direction should you fire? </p><p>The answer depends on many things: target distance, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction. </p><p>These are not complex calculations, but they were time-consuming for a human "computer" armed only with pen and paper.  </p><p>As Lt (junior grade) Hopper graduated from midshipmen's school in 1944, the navy was intrigued by the potential of an unwieldy machine recently devised by Harvard professor Howard Aiken - the Mark 1. </p><p>The navy sent Lt Hopper to help Prof Aiken work out what it could do.</p><p>Prof Aiken was not thrilled to have a female join the team, but Lt Hopper impressed him enough that he asked her to write the operating manual. </p><p>This involved plenty of trial and error. </p><p>More often than not, the Mark 1 would grind to a halt soon after starting - and there was no user-friendly error message. </p><p>Once, it was because a moth had flown into the machine - that gave us the modern term "debugging". </p><p>More often, the bug was metaphorical - a wrongly flipped switch, a mispunched hole in the paper tape. </p><p>The detective work was laborious and dull. </p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38320198" class="story-body__link">The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart</a></p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38305512" class="story-body__link">The simple steel box that transformed global trade</a></p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38498700" class="story-body__link">How the barcode changed retailing</a></p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38650976" class="story-body__link">Why the falling cost of light matters</a></p><p>Lt Hopper and her colleagues started filling notebooks with bits of tried-and-tested, re-useable code. </p><p>By 1951, computers had advanced enough to store these chunks - called "subroutines" - in their own memory systems. </p><p>By then, Grace was working for a company called Remington Rand. </p><p>She tried to persuade her employers to let programmers call up these subroutines in familiar words - to say things such as: "Subtract income tax from pay."</p><p>She later said: "No-one thought of that earlier, because they weren't as lazy as I was."  </p><p>In fact, Grace was famed for hard work. </p><p>But what Grace called a "compiler" did involve a trade-off. </p><p>It made programming quicker, but the resulting programmes ran more slowly. </p><p>That is why Remington Rand were not interested. </p><p>Every customer had their own, bespoke requirements for their shiny new computing machine. </p><p>It made sense, the company thought, for its experts to program them as efficiently as they could. </p><p>Grace was not discouraged: she simply wrote the first compiler in her spare time. </p><p>And others loved how it helped them to think more clearly. </p><p>Kurt Beyer's book, Grace Hopper and the Invention of the Information Age, relates many tales of impressed users. </p><p>One of them was an engineer called Carl Hammer, who used the compiler to attack an equation his colleagues had struggled with for months. </p><p>Mr Hammer wrote 20 lines of code, and solved it in a day. </p><p>Like-minded programmers all over the US started sending Grace new chunks of code, and she added them to the library for the next release.</p><p>In effect, she was single-handedly pioneering open-source software. </p><p>Grace's compiler evolved into one of the first programming languages, COBOL. </p><p>More fundamentally, it paved the way for the now-familiar distinction between hardware and software. </p><p>With one-of-a-kind machines such as the Harvard Mark 1, software was hardware. </p><p>No pattern of switches would also work on another machine, which would be wired completely differently. </p><p>But if a computer can run a compiler, it can also run any program that uses it.</p><p>Further layers of abstraction have since come to separate human programmers from the nitty-gritty of physical chips. </p><p>And each one has taken a further step in the direction Grace realised made sense: freeing up programmer brainpower to think about concepts and algorithms, not switches and wires. </p><p>Grace had her own views of why colleagues had been initially resistant: not because they cared about making programs run more quickly, but because they enjoyed the prestige of being the only ones who could communicate with the godlike computer. </p><p>The "high priests", Grace called them. </p><p>She thought anyone should be able to programme.</p><p>Now, anyone can. </p><p>And computers are far more useful because of it.</p>
