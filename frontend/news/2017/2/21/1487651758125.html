<p>The proposals have been put forward by local NHS bosses as part of a national programme to transform the health service and save money.</p><p>They include everything from full closures of hospitals to cutting some specialist services such as accident and emergency and stroke care.</p><p>Ministers argue patients will receive better care in the community.</p><p>But a review of the plans by the King's Fund think tank warned they were not always credible because there were not enough services outside of hospitals.</p><p>It warned GPs, district nursing and council care services were already "feeling the strain" and could not currently cope with an increase in workload.</p><p>And the King's Fund said further reductions in the number of hospital beds could de-stabilise services that were already "stretched to their limits" following the difficult winter.</p><p>Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.</p><p>Need help finding out which region you are in?
