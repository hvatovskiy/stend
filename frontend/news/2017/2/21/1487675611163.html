All this tough guy, breathy, growling, mumbling, I can't understand you!"</p><p>TV critic Emma Bullimore told the BBC: "We are living in astonishingly ambitious times for TV drama, attracting world class talent to the small screen, and sometimes this means the basics of storytelling get slightly overlooked - either in terms of audibility or making a story too complicated or difficult to follow (as Sherlock was criticised for). </p><p>"However, it does feel that mumbling is the latest bandwagon for BBC bashers to jump on and the odd muffled word gets spun into a story. Actually, my enjoyment of SS-GB wasn't marred by sound issues."</p><p>It's not the first time the issue of mumbling on TV dramas has been raised, with past programmes such as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-27142035" class="story-body__link">Jamaica Inn</a> and Happy Valley having hit the headlines over the audio.</p><p>Back in 2013, the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, told the Radio Times: "I don't want to sound like a grumpy old man but I think muttering is something we could look at."</p><p>Some have blamed actors, while others have pointed the finger at flat-screen televisions, which don't have the depth to encase larger speakers.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04tlfq5" class="story-body__link">Speaking on the Today programme</a>, ITV's Victoria creator, Daisy Goodwin, pointed out that Riley may have made a conscious choice to not speak with perfectly clear diction in keeping with his character.</p><p>SS-GB, a five-part drama, also stars Kate Bosworth as a US journalist for the New York Times.</p>
