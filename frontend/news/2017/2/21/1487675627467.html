<p>The aid organisation's spokesman Mohammed al-Misrati told the AP news agency that the bodies washed ashore on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>He said the<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2017/01/mv-aquarius-rescues-refugees-mediteranean-sea-170125103240841.html"> </a>circumstances involving the drownings were not clear yet.</p>
<p>The agency posted on its Twitter account photographs of dozens of bodies in white and black body bags, lined up along the shore.</p>

<p>Misrati also said that local authorities will take the bodies <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/11/tunisia-cemetery-unknown-refugees-161112103347956.html">to a cemetery</a> in the capital, Tripoli, that is allocated for unidentified persons.</p>
<h2>Controversial new plan</h2>
<p><span>Earlier this month, European Union leaders </span><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/eu-leaders-ink-deal-stem-refugee-flow-libya-170203151643286.html" target="_self">agreed on a controversial new plan</a><span> to help stem the flow of refugees from the North African country.</span></p>
<p>Under the new plan, the bloc would provide Libya's government with funds to increase efforts to stop refugee boats from crossing territorial waters, and to "break <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/01/world-human-smuggling-170123122824101.html">the business model</a>" of traffickers who helped 181,000 refugees enter the EU through Libya and Italy last year.</p>

<p>The announcement received a backlash from <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/human_rights.html">human rights</a> groups who said such plans exposed refugees to further risks and abuses.</p>
<p>Migrant deaths have risen to record levels along the Libya-Italy smuggling route across the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>An estimated 230 people, not including the 74 found on Tuesday, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/180-missing-people-presumed-dead-shipwreck-170117092311329.html">have died en route to Europe</a> since the start of 2017, according to the United Nations.</p>
