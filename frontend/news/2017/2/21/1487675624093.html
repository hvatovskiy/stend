<p>Susan Fowler, a software engineer, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39024445" class="story-body__link">wrote a blog post</a> about a "very, very strange year at Uber".</p><p>In it, she says her manager tried to have sex with her on her first official day at work, sending her messages about his open relationship.</p><p>It's just the latest blow for a company that has gained a reputation as a bastion of Silicon Valley's macho "bro" culture.</p><p>But is Uber really any more sexist than other tech giants in the Valley?</p><p>Ms Fowler's claims have resonated with many women in the tech world, and surveys suggest her experiences are not uncommon.</p><p>According to a 2016 survey, 60% of women working in Silicon Valley experience unwanted sexual advances.</p><p>The "<a href="https://www.elephantinthevalley.com/" class="story-body__link-external">Elephant in the Valley</a>" survey found that 87% of the 220 women interviewed had witnessed demeaning comments from their colleagues.</p><p>Almost 40% of those who said they were harassed at work did not report the situation, fearing it would damage their careers. </p><p>"I was propositioned by a hiring manager early in my career when I was a job candidate," one contributor to the study wrote.</p><p>"He clearly indicated that if I slept with him, he would make sure I was promoted as his 'second in command' as he moved up the ladder in the company."</p><p>Another said she had turned down her CEO's sexual advances the first time they travelled together for work. </p><p>"After that, I was never asked to travel with him again," she said. "This impacted my ability to do my job."</p><p>The study followed a high-profile gender discrimination <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-32094337" class="story-body__link">lawsuit in 2015 from former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao</a> - one of those praising Ms Fowler's stand against Uber. </p><p>On Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/ekp/status/833493014114734080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="story-body__link-external">Ms Pao said</a> Ms Fowler's blog post shows "the state of tech in one woman's story, also the story of many women, many people at many companies".</p><p>Discrimination is difficult to quantify - especially when victims are unwilling to speak out.</p><p>Yet on top of Ms Pao's case, there have been several high-profile lawsuits and sudden exits in the tech world in recent years:</p><p>Comparing results from different studies with different questions can be problematic - but there are some hints that Silicon Valley has a problem.</p><p>Statistics on sexual harassment vary widely, but an extensive 1992 US national study found that 41% of women had experienced it; and about 40-50% of women in the EU, according to the United Nations.</p><p>Both estimates are still lower than the Silicon Valley survey's 60%.</p><p>The 2016 Women in the Workplace study - a major US national survey - found that 19% of the technology sector's top executives are women - broadly in line with sectors like banking, media, or professional services.</p><p>The same study found that, across all industries, 30% of women who negotiated for a promotion or a better salary were told they were "bossy", "aggressive" or "intimidating".</p><p>In the Elephant in the Valley survey, that rocketed to 84% of women being told they were aggressive (though that question was not specifically about negotiation).</p><p>The world's biggest tech companies know they're dominated by white men, and many are funding schemes to address that.</p><p>In its annual diversity and inclusion report, Apple said it had closed pay gaps over the past year by analysing salaries, bonuses and stock grants. </p><p>Facebook has pledged to give $15m (£12m) to Code.org, a non-profit group teaching young women and underrepresented minorities how to write computer code.</p><p>of the three biggest tech brands&#39; employees are female - but what about their actual technical staff?</p><p><span class="ns_impact__fig">19%</span> of Google&#39;s tech workforce is female, compared to 31% within the whole firm </p><p><span class="ns_impact__fig">23%</span> of Apple&#39;s technology staff are women - and 32% of its global total, including retail </p><p><span class="ns_impact__fig">17%</span> of Facebook&#39;s technology team are women, it says - and 33% of all its staff </p><p>And in 2015, Google told USA Today it would invest $150m (£120m) in workforce diversity initiatives that year, up from $115m in 2014.</p><p>At the moment, 23% of Apple's tech employees are women.
