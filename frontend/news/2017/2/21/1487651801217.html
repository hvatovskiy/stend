<p>Guinea's main teachers' unions launched the strike on February 1 to protest the government's decision to dismiss or cut the salaries of many junior teachers after the latest civil service exams.</p>
<p>Many of their students have taken to the streets in recent days to support them.</p>
<p>Beginning early on Monday morning, unidentified assailants attacked a police station and demonstrators clashed with security forces in several districts of Conakry, witnesses told the Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>"By midday, these demonstrations had unfortunately caused the deaths of at least five people," the government said in a statement, calling the protest "illegal and forbidden".</p>
<p><span>The statement added that 30 people had been injured, including members of the security forces, and 12 arrested.</span></p>
<h2>Demand for higher salaries</h2>
<p>The two largest teacher trade unions have been on strike for weeks, demanding higher salaries and the resumption of work by contracted teachers, who are not full-time. The government, they say, is not meeting their demands.</p>
<p>The unions said their strike will continue until a pay rise of between 7.5 to 10.3 percent is met.</p>
<p>Later on Monday, the government said a deal had been struck to end the teachers' strike but that could not be immediately confirmed.</p>
<p><span>General strikes about 10 years ago caused major disruptions in Guinea, which has around a third of the world's reserves of bauxite, used to make aluminium. </span></p>
<p><span>The subsequent crackdown led by security forces led to the deaths of 135 people.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span>Â <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
