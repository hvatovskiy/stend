<p>Normally used to paralyse or kill its prey, the venom also contains a compound that appears to act as long-lasting pain relief.</p><p>In research on rats, the compound was still working three days later.</p><p>The findings meant it may be possible to create a new pain therapy for patients who had run out of options, the researchers said.</p><p>Most medicines for moderate to severe pain, called opioids, work by reducing the perception of pain.</p><p>They do this by attaching to specific proteins in the brain and organs of the body, called opioid receptors.</p><p>But the Rg1A compound found in the venom of a <i>Conus regius</i> snail, a native of the Caribbean, works in a different way using a new pathway.</p><p>Writing in the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/" class="story-body__link-external">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, scientists from the University of Utah said the compound appeared to have a beneficial effect on parts of the nervous system.</p><p>And this could open the door to new opportunities to treat pain, they said.</p><p>They said drugs that worked in this way could reduce the use of opioids, such as morphine, which are addictive and can cause a number of serious side-effects.</p><p>J Michael McIntosh, professor of psychiatry at the University of Utah Health Sciences, said: "What is particularly exciting about these results is the aspect of prevention.</p><p>"Once chronic pain has developed, it is difficult to treat," he said.</p><p>"This compound offers a potential new pathway to prevent pain from developing in the first place and offer a new therapy to patients who have run out of options."</p><p>In tests on rats, scientists found that those animals treated with a chemotherapy drug that caused them to be hypersensitive to cold and touch, experienced pain - but those also treated with the snail compound did not.</p>
