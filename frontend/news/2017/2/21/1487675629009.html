</figcaption></figure><div id="article-body" class="article-body"><p>Suicide bombers attacked a court complex in northwestern <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/pakistan.html">Pakistan</a>, killing at least six people, police said.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/tehrik-taliban.html">Pakistan Taliban</a> <span>Jamaat-ur-Ahrar faction</span><span> claimed responsibility for the attack in</span> town of Tangi in the district of Charsadda.</p>
<p>At least six people were killed and 15 wounded in Tuesday's attack, according to police and hospital officials <span>at the Tangi government hospital where the wounded are being treated. </span></p>
<p>Three suicide attackers attempted to attack the court, but as they exploded their vests, they were shot dead at the gate, another police official, Sabz Ali, told Al Jazeera. </p>
<p><span>Police sources said a search operation was launched in the area following the blast. That search has now been completed and the area was deemed clear.</span></p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2017/02/lahore-sehwan-pakistan-week-violence-170219181601253.html">wave of recent attacks</a> has gripped Pakistan. Over the past 10 days, a string of bombings has killed more than 100 people.</p>
<p>In one of the attacks last week, dozens of worshippers gathered at <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/blast-hits-pakistan-lal-shahbaz-qalandar-sufi-shrine-170216144747128.html">a famed Sufi shrine</a> were killed when an <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</a> (ISIL) group's suicide bomber walked into the shrine's main hall in the southern Sindh province and detonated his explosives. The death toll from that attack has since risen to 90.</p>
<p>The shrine bombing prompted a<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/army-kills-100-terrorists-sehwan-shrine-blast-170217142846147.html"> countrywide crackdown by security forces</a> targeting armed groups and their hideouts.</p></div>
