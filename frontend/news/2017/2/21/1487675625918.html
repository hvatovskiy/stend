<p>Judge Maya Heller of the military court in Tel Aviv delivered the sentencing on Tuesday in a case that has <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2017/01/israel-soldier-elor-azaria-170105045204308.html">stoked passions</a>, debate and protest.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected Elor Azaria, who was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/israel-soldier-elor-azaria-verdict-170104051749543.html">convicted of manslaughter</a> one month earlier, to be jailed for fewer than the maximum sentence of 20 years for killing <span>Abed al-Fattah al-Sharif.</span></p>
<p><span>"This was at the lower end of what the prosecution had asked for when they requested that Azaria would serve between three and five years," said </span>Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith, reporting from Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>In her statement, Heller claimed that there were mitigating factors to the killing, which she said took place in "hostile territory".</p>

<p>While she said that Azaria's family "suffered" as a result of the trial, she noted that Azaria has not expressed remorse.</p>
<p>The March 24 shooting, in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, was filmed by activists from the Israeli B'Tselem <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/human_rights.html">human rights</a> group.</p>
<p>That video shows Sharif, 21, lying on the ground, shot along with another Palestinian.</p>
<p>Azaria, a 20-year-old combat medic, then delivers the fatal blow, shooting him again in the head without any provocation.</p>
<p>According to the army, Sharif had stabbed and wounded another soldier.</p>
<p><span>It was unclear whether Azaria's family would follow up on a promise to appeal against a decision to imprison the soldier for more than 10 months.</span></p>
<p>Issa Amro, director of the Hebron-based Youth Against Settlements activist group, told Al Jazeera that a sentence of 18 months in jail "is not proportionate with what [Azaria] did". </p>
<p>"We are talking about a war criminal, according to international law," he said, adding that it was likely Azaria would receive a pardon from the government.</p>
<p>"I believe Azaria was following orders to execute Palestinians, and leave them bleeding until they pass away," he said. "This is what [Israeli soldiers] did in many cases in Hebron, in Jerusalem, in Ramallah. Israeli soldiers are not held to account. I've just seen soldiers celebrating Azaria getting 18 months."</p>
<p><span><br></span></p>
<h2><span>'Extrajudicial killings'</span></h2>
<p>The case raised questions about how Israeli soldiers deal with perceived threats by Palestinians.</p>
<p>Shortly after the shooting, the Palestinian leadership demanded the United Nations investigate what rights groups have called Israel's "extrajudicial killings".</p>
<p>Sharif's father, Yusri, has previously said Azaria deserves a life sentence.</p>

<p>According to a survey in August by the Israel Democracy Institute, 65 percent of the Jewish public supported Azaria and his claim of self-defence.</p>
<p>Prime Minister <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/benjamin-netanyahu.html">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> and other prominent Israeli politicians had thrown their weight behind Azaria, calling for the soldier to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/netanyahu-calls-pardon-convicted-soldier-azaria-170104190028634.html">be pardoned</a>.</p>
<p>Since October 2015, Israeli soldiers and settlers have been responsible for the killing of at least 244 Palestinians, including unarmed demonstrators, bystanders and alleged attackers in an upsurge in violence.</p>
<p>Thirty-six Israelis have also been killed in mostly stabbing and shooting incidents carried out by Palestinians.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
