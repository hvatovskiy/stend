<p>A supermarket has begun stocking <a href="https://twitter.com/asda/status/829360926679769089" class="story-body__link-external">ketchup in the fridge</a> section as well as on shelves in a bid to appease both camps. </p><p>Asda's poll of some 2,600 people found opinion was split, with 54% saying ketchup belonged in the cupboard and 46% saying they stored it in the fridge.</p><p>Some shoppers took to social media to say which part of the shop they would be heading towards.</p><p>But Polly Russell, a food historian from BBC Two's Back In Time For Dinner, said modern-day food chilling could be "bizarre".</p><p>Many brands we recognise today, such as Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire Sauce, HP Sauce and Heinz Tomato Ketchup, were all sold before households had fridges, she explains.</p><p>"They were absolute life-savers for housekeepers - adding flavour to food that might be slightly bland or monotonous," Dr Russell said.</p><p>Their acidity levels, coupled with salt and sugar content, means they were - and still are - microbiologically safe to keep at room temperature.</p><p>"Households had no fridge, only cool boxes, or ice deliveries if it was a wealthy family."</p><p>In the latest series of Further Back In Time For Dinner, the Robshaw family are sent to a 1900s house - finding a kitchen with a cool-cupboard and overstuffed parlour instead of a fridge or freezer.</p><p>So when did this change?</p><p>As late as 1961, 20% of British households had a fridge, Dr Russell's research found. Yet half of these households probably owned a television.</p><p>It was only from 1968 that half of Britons owned a fridge.</p><p>Nearly 70 years on, we are fridge-obsessed. </p><p>Ms Russell said there was now an "increased anxiety" over food safety, meaning that we tend to chill foods when we do not need to. </p><p>"Shoppers don't trust the food they buy and hear mixed messages about what is and isn't safe," she said.</p><p>But some people are attempting to resist our reliance on refrigeration.</p><p>"If we get more people into preserving food, we can reduce the need for a fridge," says Caroline Aitken, a food preservation teacher from Dartmoor.</p><p>Mrs Aitken, 38, teaches "permaculture", a movement that began in the 1970s and promotes self-sufficiency, growing food naturally and minimising waste.</p><p>"We've gradually lost our larders and now we've got very hot centrally heated houses," she said, adding that there was a "cultural fear" of leaving food out of the fridge.</p><p>She suggests pickling food from scratch using salt and water and keeping sugary preserves such as jam in the larder.</p><p>"Sauerkraut and kimchee are great to experiment with," she said. "I generally add three tablespoons of salt for every two kilos of shredded vegetables."</p><p>Mrs Aitken says people can go "over the top" with keeping food in the fridge, even once it has been cooked.</p><p>"You can have cold-store outside," she said. "If I've cooked a big stew I sit the pot in a room with a stone floor and it's perfectly fine to have the next day." </p><p>According to the government, a fridge bought in 2013 costs on average Â£269.85 to run over a 12.5-year lifespan, although it may be difficult to do without one altogether.</p><p>Even Mrs Aitken says she keeps some things, like her homemade yoghurt, in the fridge. "I just don't go over the top: tomatoes, citrus fruits, eggs, they shouldn't be in there."</p><p>Sources: NHS Food Safety advice, Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences journal</p>
