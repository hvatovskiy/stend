    <div class=""><p>For decades Colombia has struggled with a violent rebellion. Now, peace seems closer than ever with one peace treaty signed and negotiations for another having started again. However, the two largest rebel groups, <span>FARC and ELN, still have large areas of influence.</span></p>
<p>In November 2016, the government and the FARC rebels <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/colombia-signs-revised-peace-deal-farc-rebels-161124163848718.html" target="_blank">signed a peace deal</a> <span>aiming at ending half a century of war. <span>Public opinion has been divided on the deal. Some believe the FARC, or the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, should pay for crimes such as kidnappings and drug-trafficking, while others want peace to prevail.</span></span></p>
<p>Several months later, in February 2017, the government <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/colombia-eln-talks-52-years-war-170208052617750.html" target="_blank">started renewed negotiations</a> with Colombia's second largest rebel group, the National Liberation Army (ELN). The ELN <span>hopes to clinch an agreement similar to that negotiated last year with the FARC, which allows the rebels to form a political party in exchange for laying down their arms.</span></p></div>
