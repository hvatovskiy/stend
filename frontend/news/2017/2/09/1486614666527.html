<p>Captain Jeff Davis, a spokesman, said 10 operatives were killed in a single strike on 3 February.</p><p>A second strike on 4 February killed Abu Hani al-Masri, who had close ties to the late al-Qaeda leader, he said.</p><p>Al-Masri is said to have set up and run al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan during the 1980s and 1990s.</p><p>He also had close ties to Ayman al-Zawahiri, who became the leader of al-Qaeda when Bin Laden was killed by US forces in 2011.</p><p>"These strikes disrupt al-Qaeda's ability to plot and direct external attacks targeting the US and our interests worldwide," said Capt Davis.</p><p>Al-Qaeda's influence in Syria operates largely through an affiliate jihadist group, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-36924000" class="story-body__link">Jabhat Fateh al-Sham</a>, formerly known as al-Nusra Front.</p><p>The group announced in mid-2016 that it was no longer affiliated with any external group, prompting  speculation that it had cut ties with al-Qaeda, although the latter group was not mentioned by name.</p><p>It is thought that the leadership structure of Fateh al-Sham is still intertwined with al-Qaeda.</p><p>A US operation against al-Qaeda in Yemen last week - the first military action authorised by new president Donald Trump - resulted in the death of a Navy Seal and up to 16 civilians, including children, according to reports.</p>
