<p>Justice Minister Amy Adams said an application process will be introduced and cases will be judged individually.</p><p>In 1986 when the Homosexual Law Reform Act was passed, sex between men above 16 years old was decriminalised. </p><p>But convictions for consensual sex between men prior to that still appear in criminal history checks and may have to be disclosed in job applications. </p><p>Ms Adams said the government intends to introduce legislation to implement the scheme in the coming months. About 1,000 people could be eligible to apply, according New Zealand media reports.</p><p>A petition was introduced to parliament last July, asking for a process to reverse those convictions brought before 1986 and for an apology from the government. </p><p>On Thursday, Ms Adams apologised while addressing reporters.</p><p>"Although we can never fully undo the impact on the lives of those affected, this new scheme will provide a pathway for their convictions to be expunged," Ms Adams said.</p><p>"It means people will be treated as if they had never been convicted, and removes the ongoing stigma and prejudice that can arise from convictions for homosexual offences."</p><p>Only convictions between consenting adult men will be quashed, Ms Adams said, not those where the acts are still illegal today.</p>
