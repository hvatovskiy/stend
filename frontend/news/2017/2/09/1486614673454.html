<p>Dr Adriano Reis e Lameira from Durham University recorded and analysed almost 5,000 orangutan "kiss squeaks". </p><p>He found that the animals combined these purse-lipped, "consonant-like" calls to convey different messages. </p><p>This could be a glimpse of how our ancestors formed the earliest words. </p><p>The findings are published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. </p><p>"Human language is extraordinarily advanced and complex - we can pretty much transmit any information we want into sound," said Dr Reis e Lameira.</p><p>"So we tend to think that maybe words evolved from some rudimentary precursor to transmit more complex messages. </p><p>"We were basically using the orangutan vocal behaviour as a time machine - back to a time when our ancestors were using what would become [those precursors] of consonants and vowels." </p><p>The team studied kiss squeaks in particular because, like many consonants - the /t/, /p/, /k/ sounds - they depend on the action of the lips, tongue and jaw rather than the voice. </p><p>"Kiss squeaks do not involve vocal fold action, so they're acoustically and articulatory consonant-like," explained Dr Reis e Lameira.</p><p>There has been very little study of consonants in language research, but as Prof Serge Wich from Liverpool John Moores University, a lead author in the study, explained, they are crucial building blocks in the evolution of language. </p><p>"Most human languages have a lot more consonants than vowels," said Prof Wich. "And if we have more building blocks, we have more combinations." </p><p>The scientists recorded and analysed 4,486 kiss-squeaks collected from 48 animals in four wild populations. </p><p>With thousands of hours of listening as the apes communicated, the researchers found that the animals that the animals embedded several different bits of information in their squeaks.</p><p>The team compared this to how we might use more than one word to convey the same meaning - saying "car" but also "automobile" and "vehicle"</p><p>"They seemed to make doubly sure that the message was received, so they would send the same message with different [kiss squeak combination] signals," </p><p>The scientists say their study suggests that, rather than a concerted effort to form complex words, it might have been this "redundancy" - forming different sounds that had the same meaning, in order to reinforce a message - that drove early language evolution. </p>
