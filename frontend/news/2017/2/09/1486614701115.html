<p>Robert Goodwill, i<span>mmigration minister,</span> said the UK could be "proud" of its efforts helping refugees in a statement on Wednesday announcing the end of the Dubs programme, which will have helped 350 children resettle in the country when it ends in March.</p>
<p>The scheme, which took the form of an <a class="InternalLink" href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2016-05-10/debates/16051037000420/ChildRefugeeResettlement" target="_blank">amendment to immigration legislation</a>, was introduced last May after pressure from veteran British politician Lord Alf Dubs on the government to provide sanctuary to children stuck in makeshift camps in northern France.</p>
<p>Dubs himself arrived in Britain as a child refugee fleeing Nazi Germany during the second world war.</p>
<p>About 200 children have arrived in the UK under scheme since it took effect in October last year, with another 150 expected before it ends.</p>

<p>"[The] UK has a proud history of providing protection for those in need, including some of the most vulnerable children affected by the migration crisis," said Goodwill.</p>
<p>"The government’s strategy is to support international efforts to find a comprehensive and sustainable solution to the refugee crisis; we must deal with its root causes, as well as respond to the consequences."</p>
<p>Charities helping refugees in northern France had expected up to <a class="InternalLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/care4calais/posts/1151539251545697?fref=nf" target="_blank"> 3,000 child refugees</a> to be supported under the scheme.</p>
<p>Care4Calais, one of the largest charities operating in the region, posted a status update on its Facebook page in response to the decision: "We cannot let this happen".</p>
<p>A petition launched by activists has already <a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.citizensuk.org/dubs_petition#reactions" target="_blank"> picked up more than 6,000 signatures</a>.</p>
<p>Marta Welander, director of Refugee Rights Data Project, told Al Jazeera the decision to end Dubs was "deplorable".</p>
<p>"The UK government’s decision is a misguided and deplorable move that appears to go against principles of human rights and child protection," she said</p>
<p>"Our research indicates that refugee children living in precarious situations on the UK's doorstep remain in critical need of protection."</p>
<h2>'Completely wrong'</h2>
<p>Opposition politicians also weighed in, with Labour MP Yvette Cooper condemning the decision as "shameful".</p>
<p>"[The government] is completely wrong to close down Dubs scheme to help lone child refugees after less than 12 months! Refugee crisis hasn't gone away," she wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>"US President trying to close refugee programmes altogether. Now UK Gov closing Dubs programme for most vulnerable refugees of all. Shameful."</p>
<p>French authorities demolished the informal Calais refugee camp, known as The Jungle, in October.</p>

<p>The UK also operates another scheme for the resettlement of children, under which young refugees are reunited with family members already living in the UK.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera</span></p>
