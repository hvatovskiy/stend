<p>Condemning the torture and killings committed by Myanmar's security forces that - according to a UN report - possibly amount to ethnic cleansing, Francis said in a statement on Wednesday that Rohingya Muslims were targeted "simply because they want to live their culture and their Muslim faith".</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/rohingyas-killed-myanmar-crackdown-170203101817841.html" target="_blank">UN report</a> made public last week, 204 Rohingya refugees who fled to neighbouring Bangladesh were interviewed for first-hand accounts.</p>
<p>They revealed grave violations allegedly carried out by members of Myanmar's security forces, or by civilians working alongside them.</p>

<p>Security forces in Myanmar reportedly burned down entire villages and opened fire at people fleeing burning homes.</p>
<p>According to the report, the army has also been accused of "massive and systematic rape and sexual violence; deliberate destruction of food and sources of food".</p>

<p>Myanmar's army had launched clearance operations while searching for fighters behind deadly raids on police borders last year.</p>
<p>Human rights groups say the military operation has been abusive enough to be categorised as crimes against humanity.</p>
