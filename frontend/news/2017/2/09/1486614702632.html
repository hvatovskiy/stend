<p><span>Arsara - also known as Min Naing -</span> was stopped on Sunday as he drove in northern Rakhine state after authorities were tipped off that he was carrying an illegal haul, Maung Maung Yin, a police o<span>fficer, </span>said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pyin Nyar Nanda - also known as Aye Lwin - and Khone Na La - also known as Thein Shwe - were the two other monks caught by police in the town of Maung Daw over links to the narcotics found.</p>

<p><span>Maung Maung Yin said an anti-drug task force found 400,000 pills in Arsara's car.</span></p>
<p><span>A subsequent search of his monastery turned up 4.2 million pills along with a grenade and ammunition.</span></p>
<p>A statement from the office of the state counsellor for Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, said that $769 in cash was also found in the vehicle.</p>
<p>"This is not a normal case, and when we were informed that the monk was arrested, we were all shocked," said Kyaw Mya Win, a township police officer.</p>
<p>Asked about the case, <span>Soe Min Tun, </span>the director-general of the religious affairs ministry, expressed surprise.</p>
<p>"It is not a very common case, but not impossible to happen," he said.</p>
<p>"What will happen to the monk is that he will have to give up his monkhood right away and face trial as an ordinary person."</p>
<h2>Major producer</h2>
<p>Myanmar is a major producer of methamphetamine, usually smuggled from the northeast to neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>It is also the world's second biggest producer of opium, from which heroin is derived.</p>
<p>The meth pills are are hugely popular across Asia among everyone from wealthy clubbers to exhausted blue-collar employees working long shifts.</p>

<hr>
<p>Last year police confiscated a record 98 million stimulant tablets, nearly double the 50 million seized in 2015.</p>
<p>Drug prosecutions also jumped around 50 percent from 2015 to 13,500, which police said reflected the growth in the local drug trade.</p>
<p>Trafficking has particularly been on the rise in Rakhine state, home to more than a million people from the impoverished Muslim Rohingya minority.</p>
<p>In September state media reported that two men had been arrested after 6.2 million methamphetamine tablets were found in their car in Maungdaw.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
