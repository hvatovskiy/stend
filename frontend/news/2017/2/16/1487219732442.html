<p>The sunshine vitamin is vital for healthy bones, but also has a role in the immune system.</p><p>The analysis, <a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/doi/10.1136/bmj.i6583" class="story-body__link-external">published in the British Medical Journal,</a> argues food should be fortified with the vitamin.</p><p>But Public Health England (PHE) says the infections data is not conclusive, although it does recommend supplements.</p><p>These, it says, should be taken for improved bone and muscle health.   </p><p>The immune system uses vitamin D to make antimicrobial weapons that puncture holes in bacteria and viruses.</p><p>But as vitamin D is made in the skin while out in the sun, many people have low levels during winter.</p><p>Trials on using supplements to prevent infections have given mixed results, so the researchers pooled data on 11,321 people from 25 separate trials to try to get a definitive answer.</p><p>The team at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) looked at respiratory tract infections - which covers a wide range of illnesses from a sniffle to flu to pneumonia. </p><p>Overall, the study said one person would be spared infection for every 33 taking vitamin D supplements.</p><p>That is more effective than flu vaccination, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001269.pub5/abstract;jsessionid=EACCB88B8902D696A59DB7431D80F5E1.f02t02" class="story-body__link-external">which needs to treat 40 to prevent one case,</a> although flu is far more serious than the common cold.</p><p>There were greater benefits for those taking pills daily or weekly - rather than in monthly super-doses - and in people who were deficient in the first place.</p><p>One of the researchers, Prof Adrian Martineau, said: "Assuming a UK population of 65 million, and that 70% have at least one acute respiratory infection each year, then daily or weekly vitamin D supplements will mean 3.25 million fewer people would get at least one acute respiratory infection a year."</p><p>PHE already advises everyone to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36846894" class="story-body__link">take vitamin D supplements in autumn and winter</a> for the sake of healthy bones and muscles.</p><p>They are recommended all year round for some people who get little sunlight on their skin, including people in care homes or those who cover up.</p><p>However, there is considerable debate about the importance of the latest study.</p><p>Prof Louis Levy, the head of nutrition science at PHE, said: "The evidence on vitamin D and infection is inconsistent and this study does not provide sufficient evidence to support recommending vitamin D for reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections."</p><p>But Prof Martin Hewison, from the University of Birmingham and the Society for Endocrinology, said the findings were "striking".</p><p>"I agree with the authors that this study supports a new indication for vitamin D beyond its established benefits for bone health," he added.</p><p>And the research wing of the NHS, the National Institute for Health Research which funded the study, said the findings were "worthy of serious further debate".</p><p>Ultimately, the researcher team at QMUL want vitamin D to be added to food like in the US where milk is fortified.</p><p>Prof Martineau said: "Vitamin D fortification of foods provides a steady, low-level intake of vitamin D that has virtually eliminated profound vitamin D deficiency in several countries.</p><p>"By demonstrating this new benefit of vitamin D, our study strengthens the case for introducing food fortification to improve vitamin D levels in countries such as the UK where profound vitamin D deficiency is common."</p>
