<p>The Houston metropolitan area was hit by two tornadoes, which ripped off house roofs, blew out windows and left tens of thousands of people without power.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said the twisters touched down in Fort Bend County, about 50km southwest of Houston, causing damage to structures.</p>
<p>Tornado warnings were duly issued across large parts of Houston, which is the fourth most-populous city in the US</p>
<p>More than 215,000 people were forced to shelter at the Houston Independent School until the storm passed through. CenterPoint Energy Inc said more than 20,000 customers were without power for a time.</p>
<p>When the storms did move through, they were followed by a spell of heavy rain and snow. Waco recorded 53mm of rain in the 24 hours up to 18:00GMT on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Rather more unusually, Amarillo had a dusting of snow. This part of the Texas Panhandle does not often sees snow and this covering did bring much of the city to a standstill.</p>
<p>There were a number of accidents reported on the slippery roads.</p>
<p>Conditions are now improving as warmer, drier air moves in from the west.</p>
