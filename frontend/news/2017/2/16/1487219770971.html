<p>More than 13,000 polling stations <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/indonesia-thousands-rally-blasphemy-jakarta-161104130944560.html">opened</a> across Jakarta on Wednesday to accommodate the 7.1 million people eligible to vote, one of dozens of elections taking place across the Muslim-majority country.</p>

<p>Early vote tallies by private pollsters showed incumbent Governor Basuki "Ahok" Tjahaja Purnama, whose campaign was hurt by <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/jakarta-governor-ahok-blasphemy-trial-161213035207985.html">blasphemy charges</a>, holding a narrow lead over Anies Rasyid Baswedan, a former education minister.</p>
<p><span>The other candidate, Agus Yudhoyono, the son of former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, was in third place with 16.78 percent. </span></p>
<p>A candidate needs to get more than 50 percent of the votes in the first round to win outright. </p>
<p>Officials are expected to announce the final results in about two weeks, while <span>a second round will be held is April.</span></p>
<h2>Blasphemy allegations</h2>
<p>Ahok, an ethnic Chinese Christian, has been dogged by a blasphemy case following comments he made about the Quran that were deemed insulting to Islam and Muslims.</p>
<p>In September, he told a crowd of his supporters that if they were afraid of going to hell if they elected a non-Muslim as their leader, they need not worry as they had been lied to "using Surah Al-Maidah verse 51".</p>

</div>
<p>Some Muslims interpret the Quranic verse in question as prohibiting them from electing non-Muslims as their leaders.</p>
<p>Ahok has denied that he intended to insult the Quran, saying he was referring to those who misused religion for political purposes.</p>
<p>After two <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/indonesia-thousands-rally-blasphemy-jakarta-161104130944560.html">massive protests</a> by conservative Muslims, he was charged and is now on trial for blasphemy, though he remains free to contest the poll.</p>
<p>"It has been a polarising election here for the highest office in Indonesia's capital," Al Jazeera's Step Vaessen, reporting from a polling station in Jakarta, said.</p>
<p>"With religion playing an unprecedented role, many fear that the outcome has not only been determined by the quality of the candidate but also by his beliefs."</p>
<h2>Jakarta issues</h2>
<p>The campaign period was also marked by rising anti-Chinese sentiment sparked by false news spreading online, including rumours that millions of Chinese were coming to Indonesia illegally.</p>
<p>Ahok has won praise from many Jakartans for cleaning up rivers clogged with rubbish, as part of his flood prevention programme, and building more parks.</p>

<p>"With around 10 million people, Jakarta is one of Asia's most densely populated cities," Vaessen said.</p>
<p>"The capital battles yearly flooding and daily traffic congestion. Before Ahok's blasphemy trial, his approval ratings for tackling problems was more than 70 percent."</p>
<p>But Ahok's critics say his moves to evict squatters and slum dwellers to make way for development have increased poverty and caused dispossession.</p>
<p>Ahok's closest rival, Baswedan, has courted the votes of conservative Muslims despite his past reputation as a liberal Muslim reformer.</p>
<p>Support from conservatives rose after he visited the headquarters of the Islamic Defenders Front, whose leader, Muhammad Rizieq Shihab, was a key member of the anti-Ahok protests.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">Al Jazeera and news agencies</span></p>
