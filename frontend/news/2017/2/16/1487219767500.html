<p>The ultimatum came on Wednesday during Mattis' first visit to the NATO headquarters in Brussels, since he was sworn in last month.</p>
<p><span>"If your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to this alliance, each of your capitals need to show support for our common defence," Mattis said.</span> </p>
<p>He told the alliance's 27 other defence ministers to adopt a plan that sets dates for governments to meet a military funding goal of two percent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>Mattis's message to his counterparts in Brussels follows years of demands by the US for allies to spend at least two percent of their GDP on defence, a goal that only a handful meet despite agreeing on it at a summit in 2014.</p>
<p>Currently, only the United States, Britain, Estonia, Greece and Poland have hit or surpassed the two percent figure.</p>

<p>Asked about Mattis' ultimatum, NATO chief Stoltenberg said allies need time to develop plans. Many are already talking about increasing commitments, he added.</p>
<p><span>Stoltenberg</span> denied that Mattis's words amounted to a threat, saying it was a "firm message" and that his colleagues agreed that they would do more to contribute.</p>
<p>"That message is about the importance of fair burden-sharing. It reflects a political reality in the United States," Stoltenberg told a press conference.</p>
<p>Despite lambasting some NATO partners' spending, Mattis hailed NATO as the "fundamental bedrock" of transatlantic security as he sought to reassure allies about President Donald Trump's commitment to the alliance.</p>
<p>Even though, Trump had previously said the alliance was "obsolete" and that US helot to NATO might depend on how much they have paid.  Since his inauguration, he has taken a more orthodox stance on NATO and reaffirmed the long-standing US commitment to the alliance.</p><p style="margin-top: 3em;"><span style="color: #8e8e8e !important;">Source:</span> <span style="color: #212121 !important;">News agencies</span></p>
