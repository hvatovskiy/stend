<p>"With great sadness and sorrow, we mourn the martyr of the nation and his duty, the righteous son Juma Mohammed Abdullah al-Kaabi, who gave his pure soul for the sake of humanity," the ministry said in a statement quoted by official news agency WAM.</p>
<p>The diplomats were expected to open a number of UAE-backed projects as part of an aid programme in <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/afghanistan.html">Afghanistan</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/taliban.html">Taliban</a> denied carrying out the bombing, saying the attack was a result of "internal local rivalry".</p>
