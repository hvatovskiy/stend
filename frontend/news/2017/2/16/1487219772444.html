<p>Pakistani Taliban, Tehreek e-Taliban, claimed Wednesday's attack which follows a recent surge in violence across the country.</p>
<p><span>"</span><span>We claim responsibility for the suicide attack on the vehicle of the judiciary. The man who carried out the suicide attack was the brave warrior Sabir Swati," the group said in a statement, as it warned of further attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>"Remember that the Pakistani judiciary and those [...] who work for it are an obstacle to the imposition of an Islamic system. These people are the reason for mujahideen [fighters] being imprisoned or executed."</span></p>
<p>The attacker, who rammed his motorcycle into the van, appeared to be targeting government judicial employees in the Hayatabad area, police officials said.</p>
<p>"There was a suicide bomber on a motorcycle … the driver of the van has been killed, and four others have been wounded," said senior police official Sajjad Ahmed, speaking to media at the site of the explosion.</p>
<p>Tauheed Zulfiqar, a spokesman for the nearby Hayatabad Medical Complex where the wounded were being treated, confirmed the death toll.</p>
<p>Images of the blast showed the mangled wreckage of the van crashed into a low wall, with its windows and doors badly damaged.</p>
<p>Police cordoned off the site and deployed a security perimeter.</p>
<p>"We have found body parts of the bomber as well as his motorcycle, which hit the van," said Ahmed. <span>"We have started a search operation, we will be able to share more information after it is completed."</span></p>
<p>Muhammad Tahir, Peshawar's police chief, said: "The initial analysis shows that at least 15kg of explosives were used in this attack."</p>
<p>Prominent opposition politician Imran Khan was due to visit the nearby Hayatabad Medical Complex later in the day, and police had been directed to secure the area.</p>
<p>A bomb disposal unit team and additional security had been dispatched to the area hours earlier, police sources said.</p>
<p>"Security was on high alert, because [Imran Khan] had to go to this hospital," provincial Information Minister Mushtaq Ghani told local television channel Dawn.</p>
<p>The attack came hours after a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/suicide-attack-kills-mohmand-agency-ghalanai-170215063112154.html">suicide bombing at a government office</a> in the nearby Mohmand tribal area, which killed at least five people, including three policemen and two civilians.</p>
<p>On Monday, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/pakistan-powerful-bomb-blast-rocks-lahore-170213133330696.html">at least 13 people were killed</a> when a suicide blast targeted police officers at a protest in the eastern city of Lahore.</p>
