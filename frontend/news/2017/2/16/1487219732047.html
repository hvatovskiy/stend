"And I like the one that both parties like. I'm very happy with the one that both parties like. </p><p>"I can live with either one. I thought for a while that two states looked like it may be the easier of the two. </p><p>"To be honest, if Bibi [Mr Netanyahu] and the Palestinians, if Israel and the Palestinians are happy - I'm happy with the one they like the best."</p><p>He said it would ultimately be up to the parties themselves to reach a peace agreement.        </p><p>Mr Trump was also asked about his election promise to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which could have serious implications for any peace negotiations.</p><p>"As far as the embassy moving to Jerusalem, I'd love to see that happen," Mr Trump said.  </p><p>"And we're looking at it very, very strongly. We're looking at it with a great care, a great care, believe me. And we'll see what happens." </p><p>When he was asked about a two-state solution, Mr Netanyahu said he wanted to focus on "substance" and not "labels".</p><p>"There are two prerequisites for peace," said the Israeli prime minister. "First the Palestinians must recognise the Jewish state. </p><p>"Second, in any peace agreement, Israel must retain the overriding security control over the entire area west of the Jordan River."</p><p>Meanwhile the Palestinian presidency stressed its commitment to a two-state solution and an end to the Israeli occupation, Reuters news agency reported.

A lot was at stake, especially after the eight years of the strained relations with the Obama administration. </p><p>Ahead of the meeting, the general sentiment among them concerned the lack of clarity on how the meeting between the two leaders would go. Whether they will get along and mostly what will be said on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the two-state solution, a formula which has been a long-term tenet of US and Israeli policy. </p><p>Waiting in the East Room for the press conference, journalists were filing reports, posting on social media and also getting their selfies taken with White House insignias. So did Israeli officials. </p><p>The two leaders entered the room, and as very warm words were exchanged, it looked like the turning of a page in the relationship between the two countries. </p>
