He immediately told his young children Ellie and Lennon.</p><p>"I told them I had been for an operation but they couldn't get the cancer out and there is nothing we can do. I told them that even though I look ok on the outside, I don't feel fine inside.</p><p>"I said that yes I will die but that I'll fight for as long as I can.</p><p>"It was devastating to hear my wee boy say 'daddy I don't want you to go'."</p><p>Sammy told his children to ask him any questions but they still refuse to discuss his illness with close family and he worries that they are blocking out the information.</p><p>Adele Hanna, 52, and her late husband, Richard, broke the news of Richard's prostate cancer when their three-year-old sons saw him taking tablets at dinner.</p><p>"I was cooking tea, and one of the boys asked if the medicine was going to make daddy better.</p><p>"Me and Richard just looked at each other, we both became tearful, eventually I took a deep breath before starting a simple conversation saying, 'no daddy isn't going to get better, daddy is seriously ill and he is going to die. You're not going to see him again."</p><p>She said that brutal honesty was the best strategy for her family.</p><p>"It was hard, very hard. My husband had to walk out of the room.</p><p>"When he returned we talked about daddy's tears and mine - after all, it's normal to cry when you feel sad. </p><p>"We had a big hug and all cried, followed by lots of kisses. The boys finished their dinner, swinging their feet and chitter-chatting.</p><p>"It is about being kind, being honest and being clear, which is not easy at a time of fear, panic, anger and denial," Adele says.</p><p>Adele and Richard also emphasised to their sons that their dad did not want to die and that it was nobody's fault but it would definitely happen.</p><p>"Say the big words and be as factual as you can," she explains.</p><p>Natasha Boor's mum, Rebecca, died from cancer 10 years ago - but Natasha, who is 26 and now a care assistant in Kendal, barely remembers her mum discussing it. </p><p>"She said it was an illness like a growth or alien growing in her stomach and she would get surgery. </p><p>"When it didn't work she said she just needed some medicine."</p><p>Rebecca died shortly afterwards, but even to this day, Natasha is not sure what type of cancer she had. </p><p>"I overheard her she saying she was scared of dying - but that was different to what she was telling me.</p><p>"I don't remember her telling me she would die."</p><p>The mystery around her mum's sickness made Natasha feel like her family were keeping secrets, and she connects this to anxiety and hypochondria she has experienced as an adult.</p><p>"I grew paranoid about things being kept quiet and I have unanswered questions and memories about things that happened at the time, things I can't ask anyone about."</p><p>Natasha doesn't blame her mum for hiding information.</p><p>"My mum was an amazing, honest and open woman but she was also very proud - she didn't want me to see her upset or in pain."</p><p>Now Natasha tries to channel her memories of her mum.</p><p>"I've adopted her loud laugh so I feel like she's shining through me - I am getting married on her birthday so I feel like she is part of my wedding too."</p><p>Natasha's advice to parents who find themselves having to tell their children about a serious illness is to be fully open.</p><p>"Tell your children about every step so they know what's happening - make sure they're aware of what is going on for their sake and for their future."</p><p>Join the conversation on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFamilyNews/?fref=ts" class="story-body__link-external">Facebook page</a>.</p>
