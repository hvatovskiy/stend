<p>The number of reported hate crimes for the July to September quarter rose from 10,793 in 2015 to 14,295 for the same period last year.</p>
<p>The report on Wednesday by the Press Association said 33 out of the UK's 44 police forces had witnessed record numbers of such crimes.</p>
<p>Authorities in three areas recorded more than 1,000 incidents during the period.</p>

<hr>
<p>Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire police forces dealt with just over a 1,000 cases each, and London's Metropolitan police force recorded 3,356 cases.</p>
<p>The British government said it was working on ways to tackle hate crime and provide help to its victims.</p>
<p>"Crime motivated by hostility and prejudice towards any group in society has no place whatsoever in a Britain that works for everyone," <span>a Home Office spokesman said.</span></p>
<p>"The action we are taking is working and more victims are finding the confidence to come forward to report these crimes."</p>
<h2>Anti-European attacks</h2>
<p>Eastern European migrants to the UK were particularly affected in the aftermath of the vote to leave the EU, or Brexit.</p>
<p>Within days of the June 23 referendum, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/poland-shocked-xenophobic-abuse-poles-uk-160627105512611.html"> Polish communities reported a series of incidents, </a>including the distribution of leaflets describing them as "vermin" and racist graffiti outside a cultural centre in London.</p>
<p>In September, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/uk-polish-man-latest-victim-hate-crime-surge-160913153112373.html"> a group of 20 youths attacked a Polish man</a> <span>In the northern English city of Leeds in</span>, leaving him needing hospital treatment.</p>
<p>In another attack in the town of Harlow, near London, in December, a Polish man was beaten to death in a suspected hate crime attack after, <a class="InternalLink" href="http://video.aljazeera.com/channels/eng/videos/vigil-held-for-polish-man-stabbed-in-uk/5107574349001" target="_blank">his family members said</a>, he was heard speaking the Polish language.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the anti-racist activist group, Hope not Hate, said the referendum exposed hateful ideas already present in British society.</p>
<p>"We do need to expose those encouraging such hatred, whether on the political fringe or inside extreme right-wing groups. The authorities must ensure any perpetrators face the full force of the law," the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>"It's also imperative to sensibly discuss issues such as immigration away from hyperbole and invective."</p>

<p>The campaign to leave the EU was criticised for its <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/06/brexit-anti-immigration-ukip-poster-raises-questions-160621112722799.html"> heavy anti-immigration rhetoric</a>, and the issue of immigration <a class="InternalLink" href="http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/" target="_blank"> played a big part </a> in the decision to leave the bloc.</p>
<p>Nigel Farage, the then leader of the anti-EU UK Independence party (UKIP), unveiled a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/06/brexit-anti-immigration-ukip-poster-raises-questions-160621112722799.html">poster</a> featuring a queue of hundreds of refugees entering Europe with the caption "Breaking Point".</p>
<p>The image was roundly condemned by British politicians, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/britain-eu-vote-leave-ukip" target="_blank">including members of his own party</a>, and some activists on social media compared it to propaganda images used by the Nazis. </p>
<p>Reacting to Wednesday's report, Paul Nuttall, <span>the current leader of UKIP, </span>said the data, which was collected by the police forces themselves, was "fabricated".</p>
<p><a class="InternalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-leader-paul-nuttall-rise-in-hate-crimes-a7560381.html" target="_blank"> He told the Independent newspaper </a>the figures were "overblown specifically to try to rubbish Brexit". </p>
